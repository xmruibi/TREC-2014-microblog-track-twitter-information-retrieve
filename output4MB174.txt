view larger this is a digitized sky survey image of the oldest star with a welldetermined age in our galaxy the aging star cataloged as hd lies lightyears away the angloaustralian observatory aao uk schmidt telescope photographed the star in blue light credit digitized sky survey dss stsciaura palomarcaltech and ukstuaao a team of astronomers using nasas hubble space telescope has taken an important step closer to finding the birth certificate of a star thats been around for a very long time we have found that this is the oldest known star with a welldetermined age said howard bond of pennsylvania state university in university park pa and the space telescope science institute in baltimore md the star could be as old as billion years plus or minus billion years which at first glance would make it older than the universes calculated age of about billion years an obvious dilemma but earlier estimates from observations dating back to placed the star as old as billion years and this age range presented a potential dilemma for cosmologists maybe the cosmology is wrong stellar physics is wrong or the stars distance is wrong bond said so we set out to refine the distance the new hubble age estimates reduce the range of measurement uncertainty so that the stars age overlaps with the universes age as independently determined by the rate of expansion of space an analysis of the microwave background from the big bang and measurements of radioactive decay this methuselah star cataloged as hd has been known about for more than a century because of its fast motion across the sky the high rate of motion is evidence that the star is simply a visitor to our stellar neighborhood its orbit carries it down through the plane of our galaxy from the ancient halo of stars that encircle the milky way and will eventually slingshot back to the galactic halo this conclusion was bolstered by the s astronomers who were able to measure a deficiency of heavier elements in the star as compared to other stars in our galactic neighborhood the halo stars are among the first inhabitants of our galaxy and collectively represent an older population from the stars like our sun that formed later in the disk this means that the star formed at a very early time before the universe was largely polluted with heavier elements forged inside stars through nucleosynthesis the methuselah star has an anemic th as much of the heavy element content of our sun and other stars in our solar neighborhood the star which is at the very first stages of expanding into a red giant can be seen with binoculars as a thmagnitude object in the constellation libra hubbles observational prowess was used to refine the distance to the star which comes out to be lightyears bond and his team performed this measurement by using trigonometric parallax where an apparent shift in the position of a star is caused by a change in the observers position the results are published in the february issue of the astrophysical journal letters the parallax of nearby stars can be measured by observing them from opposite points in earths orbit around the sun the stars true distance from earth can then be precisely calculated through straightforward triangulation once the true distance is known an exact value for the stars intrinsic brightness can be calculated knowing a stars intrinsic brightness is a fundamental prerequisite to estimating its age before the hubble observation the european space agencys hipparcos satellite made a precise measurement of the stars parallax but with an age measurement uncertainty of billion years one of hubbles three fine guidance sensors measured the position of the methuselah star it turns out that the stars parallax came out to be virtually identical to the hipparcos measurements but hubbles precision is five times better that than of hipparcos bonds team managed to shrink the uncertainty so that the age estimate was five times more precise with a better handle on the stars brightness bonds team refined the stars age by applying contemporary theories about the stars burn rate chemical abundances and internal structure new ideas are that leftover helium diffuses deeper into the core and so the star has less hydrogen to burn via nuclear fusion this means it uses fuel faster and that correspondingly lowers the age also the star has a higher than predicted oxygentoiron ratio and this too lowers the age bond thinks that further oxygen measurement could reduce the stars age even more because the star would have formed at a slightly later time when the universe was richer in oxygen abundance lowering the upper age limit would make the star unequivocally younger than the universe put all of those ingredients together and you get an age of billion years with a residual uncertainty that makes the stars age compatible with the age of the universe said bond this is the best star in the sky to do precision age calculations by virtue of its closeness and brightness this methuselah star has seen many changes over its long life it was likely born in a primeval dwarf galaxy the dwarf galaxy eventually was gravitationally shredded and sucked in by the emerging milky way over billion years ago the star retains its elongated orbit from that cannibalism event therefore its just passing through the solar neighborhood at a rocketlike speed of miles per hour it takes just years to traverse a piece of sky with the angular width of the full moon the stars proper motion angular rate is so fast milliarcseconds an hour that hubble could actually photograph its movement in literally a few hours the hubble space telescope is a project of international cooperation between nasa and the european space agency nasas goddard space flight center in greenbelt md manages the telescope the space telescope science institute stsci in baltimore md conducts hubble science operations stsci is operated by the association of
