quirinus quirrell saving rons sister from the chamber of secrets forming dumbledores army and fighting in numerous battles of the second wizarding war including the battle of the department of mysteries the battle of the astronomy tower battle of the seven potters and the battle of hogwarts ron also became a gryffindor prefect and a keeper on the gryffindor quidditch team during his fifth year at hogwarts he skipped his last year of school in order to accompany harry and hermione on a quest to destroy the horcruxes of lord voldemort and fought in the battle of hogwarts in in which he lost his brother fred a loss which devastated him and his family after the war ron along with harry potter and neville longbottom joined the aurors at the invitation of minister for magic kingsley shacklebolt in order to track down death eaters who escaped capture eventually he went to work at weasleys wizard wheezes with his brother george he and hermione eventually married and had two children a daughter named rose and a son named hugo ron was also the godfather to james sirius potter his sister ginny weasley and harry potters eldest child ronald bilius weasley was the sixth of seven children born to arthur and molly weasley n e prewett and got his middle name from his uncle he was born at the height of the first wizarding war in ottery st catchpole england in the fighting his maternal uncles fabian and gideon prewett both members of the order of the phoenix were killed fighting antonin dolohov and four other death eaters while he was still a toddler the wizarding world became peaceful again for a time after lord voldemorts first defeat on october ron and his five older brothers bill charlie percy and fred and george as well as his younger sister ginny grew up in the burrow on the outskirts of ottery st catchpole in devon like all his siblings he was home educated in reading writing and simple maths by his mother the weasley family was not wealthy at all compared to other wizarding families many other pureblood families particularly the malfoys disdained them for their blood traitor beliefs and lack of wealth they tried their best to make up for this with their love the weasley siblings especially fred and george were fond of teasing and playing pranks on each other and ron was a particular target for fred and george they once transfigured rons teddy bear into a giant spider sparking his arachnophobia on another occasion the twins nearly got him to make an unbreakable vow which finally made their father truly furious and fred would later state that his left buttock has never been the same since after the row that ensued they also once got him to eat an acid pop which burnt a hole through his tongue when ron was younger he had a pet rat named scabbers this rat was actually peter pettigrew a traitor to all wizard kind ron was very fond of scabbers but wasnt sad to let him go when he found out the truth about his old rat ron had a fairly happy childhood which harry who had been brought up by his spiteful relatives the dursleys envied education at hogwarts first year ron and harry flying a car to school in their second year having not heard from harry potter during the whole summer of ron fred and george weasley in a planned scheme to rescue him from privet drive drove arthur weasleys flying ford anglia to the muggle town of little whinging and tore the bars from harrys bedroom window using the cars horsepower ron helped harry get his things in the car and they left for the weasley house upon landing ron and his brothers were ratted out by molly weasley for having taken such a risky course of action at the start of that years school term ron and harry missed the hogwarts express due to the tricks of dobby the houseelf and were forced to use the ford anglia to travel to hogwarts at the end of their journey the car failed causing the boys to crashland into the whomping willow they were nearly killed when the tree shaked and the car jettisoned them and took off into the forbidden forest where it remained rons wand was damaged in the crash causing him problems for the entire school year for instance it backfired when ron attempted to curse draco malfoy in payback for calling hermione by the offensive term mudblood malfoys disdain towards muggleborns led ron harry and hermione to suspect that he was the heir of slytherin who opened the chamber of secrets that year unleashing a monster that began to attack muggleborn students to investigate this theory hermione brewed polyjuice potion which greatly surprised ron in that she was so overtly breaking the rules when the time came to use the potion ron was made to impersonate vincent crabbe and harry impersonated gregory goyle while hermiones transformation was unsuccessful because she mistook hair from millicent bulstrodes cat for her own ron and harry realised that malfoy was not the heir of slytherin and were both greatly upset when hermione became another victim of the monster ending up petrified in the hospital wing though she left her friends a clue that led them to deduce that the monster was a basilisk ron and harry raise their wands against lockhart ron showed incredible bravery during the course of their investigation by venturing into the forbidden forest to an acromantula den led by aragog in spite of his extreme fear of spiders when he and harry learned that rons younger sister ginny was dying in the chamber of secrets they raced to save her planning to give their information to professor gilderoy lockhart when the pair discovered that the professor was cowardly attempting to flee they drew their wands on him and forced him to join them as they ventured into the chamber of secrets shortly after ron harry and lockhart entered the chamber lockhart attempted to wipe their memories in order to get out of the chamber and take credit for their efforts in a bid for fame unfortunately for him he used rons damaged wand and the spell backfired causing permanent amnesia in lockhart ron was left behind to tend to lockhart as harry delved deeper into the chamber saving ginny and defeating salazar slytherins basilisk ron was honoured with a special award for services to the school as well as earning two hundred house points for gryffindor for his work concerning resealing the chamber of secrets third year ron is his fourth year in the summer of ron invited harry and hermione to accompany the weasleys to the quidditch world cup which was being held in britain for the first time in decades while hermione joined the weasleys at the burrow harry had to be picked up from the dursleys arthur weasley arranged to pick up harry via floo network not knowing that the dursleys fireplace was blocked so when ron arthurfred and george tried to fetch harry they ended up stuck in the chimmney part of the dursleys house was destroyed before harry returned to the weasleys house the following day harry hermione and all the weasleys except molly weasley left for the quidditch world cup where they set up camp and met many of their friends from hogwarts or the ministry they had prime seats for the match thanks to mr weasley who had helped ludo bagman head of the department of magical games and sports out of a messy problem during the match ron watched his quidditch hero viktor krum the bulgarian seeker play an excellent match catching the snitch to end the game ron harry and hermione after the riot of the quidditch world cup that night while the irish supporters were still awake celebrating their victory trouble began the death eaters former followers of lord voldemort who had escaped imprisonment in askaban chose to let off a riot wearing uniforms they attacked the camp where ron and his friends and family were staying in the incident mr weasley ordered ron harry hermione fred george and ginny to run for their lives while he and the older weasley children set off to help the ministry of magic running off into the woods ron hermione and harry quickly lost fred george and ginny but they did find draco malfoy malfoy meanly suggested that hermione could be a muggleborn target of the death eaters causing ron to insist that she and harry join him in going deeper into the woods soon they reached a patch of woods giving off a silver glow where the trio found a few veela witches and their admiring wizard boyfriends ron was entranced and claimed he created a broomstick that could fly to space however they would soon come across something more sinister than the veela witches deeper yet they went and in a clearing they saw a man cast the dark mark after which ron harry and hermione were questioned by the ministry ron in his bedroom with his dress robes before the start of school on september ron and his friends departed for hogwarts aboard the hogwarts express where he was taunted and his father and new dress robes were insulted by draco malfoy and that evening at the welcoming feast dumbledore announced that hogwarts would host the triwizard tournament ron found himself caught up in dreams of being a triwizard champion but he was snapped back to reality by his fourth year classes in care of magical creatures hagrid had his students breed terrifying blastended skrewts and in defence against the dark arts ron was impressed by the new professor madeye moody when he taught the class about the three unforgivable curses it was announced that the students from the durmstrang institute and beauxbatons academy of magic would be arriving at hogwarts on october ron was impressed by the uniform in which the foreign students arrived in and was surprised when he saw viktor krum among the durmstrang students having discussed the possibility of somehow outsmarting the goblet of fire and the age line that dumbledore had cast around it ron was surprised to find that harrys name had come out of the goblet of fire jealous of harrys fame and wealth ron refused to accept that harry didnt want to enter the tournament and accused harry of cheating after the argument he and harry stopped talking to each other and ron began hanging out with other gryffindors like dean thomas and seamus finnigan ron and harry did not talk until after the first task of the triwizard tournament seeing danger ron came to the conclusion that someone would have to be mad enough to purposely put their name in the goblet of fire after harry had passed his first task ron joined hermione in congratulating harry and the two became best friends once again ron in his yule ball dress robes soon after the first task professor mcgonagall told ron and the other griyffindor boys about the traditional yule ball held during the triwizard tournament while all students above fourth year scampered around trying to find dates ron and harry found it hard to ask girls to the ball struck by the beauty and charm of fleur delacour the triwizard champion from beauxbatons academy and a partveela witch ron badly asked her to attend the ball with him but fled in horrifying embarrassment he also offended hermione first by not asking her and then by suggesting that she did not have a date and thus could accompany him harry was eventually able to get them both dates with twins parvati and padma patil rons evening was a fiasco of the first sort his traditional weasley dress robes embarrassed him and his date padma patil and when ron saw hermione with his quidditch hero viktor krum he was really jealous this led to a blazing argument between them during the end of the yule ball though their friendship did not suffer it was clear that both held feelings for each other though it would be years before it became obvious to ron harry retrieving a captive ron during the second task during the yule ball ron had overheard hagrid telling the beaubaxtons headmistress olympe maxime that he was a halfgiant this information was also overheard by daily prophet reporter rita skeeter who wrote an arcticle telling the wizarding world of hagrids secret this drove hagrid into secret hiding and he did not return to hogwarts until ron harry and hermione proved that they still liked him no matter what on february ron was taken as harrys hostage for the second task of the triwizard tournament when he found out that harry had stayed behind to save fleurs hostage gabrielle delacour as well ron took him to task but changed his tune when harry was given extra points for loyalty to other champions fleur however was impressed and she thanked ron and harry in turn for helping save her sister gabrielle kissing both of them on the cheek this resulted in ron having a very obvious crush on fleur early in the spring ron joined harry and hermione in visiting sirius black who had taken to hiding in hogsmeade there they discussed the disappearances of ministry officials barty crouch sr and bertha jorkins harry also ran his theories about severus snape by sirius but they were shot down to rons chagrin in the weeks leading up to the final tournament task ron and hermione helped harry prepare by researching and trying out different jinxes and other helpful spells for the task ron and hermione watched harry together from the sidelines they were shocked when harry returned with cedric diggorys dead body they rushed to the hospital wing after the mourning but they did not find harry there ron was relieved to see harry when he was brought to the infirmary by professor dumbledore eagerly wanted to question harry about diggory but he was told off by molly weasley who along with his brother bill weasley had come to watch harry ron was furious with the minister of magic cornelius fudge when he refused to believe harry and dumbledore and calmed molly when she was shocked by blacks appearance in the room ron did not go against harrys story when he finally heard it sticking by his best friend fifth year ron after winning a quidditch game for gryffindor in during the summer following the battle ron learned he had received seven owls only failing divination and history of magic ron explained he did not mind as he wasnt planning to take those in his sixth year regardless also during that summer ron learned that his brother bill was engaged to fleur delacour while this annoyed his mother sister and later hermione ron took to defending fleur and if she surprised him he would still take on that dumbstruck look his soft spot for fleur particularly annoyed hermione who was finding it harder to keep her feelings for him under wraps when ron and hermione learned that harry was in fact the chosen one ron was shocked and amazed but remained at harrys side ron would suffer much personal turmoil in his sixth year harry was named gryffindor team captain ron was nervous about quidditch tryouts but beat out cormac mclaggen in saves partly because hermione cast a confundus charm on mclaggen in retaliation for him insulting ron and ginny he was also envious when harry and hermione were invited to the slug club while the new potions professor horace slughorn ignored him and when he was paid attention to he usually got his name wrong during this time ron showed brief flashes of jealousy about harry and hermiones closeness he would take exception whenever hermione complimented harry on something ron thought was equally due to him ron was temporarily mollified about this when hermione asked if he would like to attend the clubs christmas party with her and he agreed ron was also worried over his sisters increasing involvement with boys and after stumbling upon her kissing dean thomas he blew up at her in retaliation ginny belittled him for his complete inexperience with the opposite gender declaring that harry and hermione had also snogged people the siblings treated each other coldly afterwards and ron was so bothered by this and by the revelation that hermione had kissed viktor krum almost two years earlier that he began to perform poorly in quidditch he also began to treat hermione with a cold indifference which confused her he even offered to resign from the team to boost his confidence harry pretended to pour the felix felicis into rons pumpkin juice at breakfast harry even allowed hermione to see the vial so she would object to the cheating this convinced ron that he had an edge in the game which caused him to play excellently however when after the match harry revealed it was a trick ron rounded on hermione and accused her of having no faith in his abilities ron after ingesting poison shortly thereafter ron began his exhibitionist relationship with lavender brown hermione incredibly angry and hurt by rons vindictive actions conjured a flock of canaries to attack him the birds scratched ron badly and he and hermione stopped talking to each other hermione attended the slug clubs christmas party she had originally wanted to attend with ron but went with his hated rival cormac mclaggen while ron snogged lavender in public and made fun of hermiones behaviour in transfiguration class reducing her to tears by christmas break however ron was becoming disenchanted with his relationship with lavender who had become increasingly possessive annoyed him with the nickname wonwon and gave him a gift of a necklace that said my sweetheart hermione did not come to the the burrow for the holidays as she usually did and ron made an attempt to speak to her after returning to school but she ignored him in march ron ate chocolate that he believed to be from his birthday presents but was in fact a gift from romilda vane to harry spiked with a love potion upon ingesting the chocolate ron became maddened with an obsessive need to see and be with romilda when he was taken to slughorns office to get an antidote he was nearly killed by poisoned mead intended for albus dumbledore harry managed to save ron with a bezoar a panicstricken hermione arrived at the hospital wing forgetting her anger with him ron said hermiones name in his sleep upon hearing her speak for the first time all day and the two quietly reconciled after his neardeath experience ron also took to feigning sleep whenever lavender tried to visit him his subsequent avoidance of lavender and simultaneous spending more time with hermione made lavender suspicious after she spotted him and hermione leaving the boys dormitories seemingly alone harry was with them but under his cloak of invisibility lavender ended the relationship much to rons relief hermione sits by rons bedside after he was poisoned a little later ron was suitably impressed when harry told him and hermione how he managed to obtain the horcrux memory from professor slughorn a few weeks later when harry used sectumsempra on draco malfoy ron lent his potions book to harry so professor snape would not confiscate the halfblood princes book throughout this school year ron had defended harrys use of the halfblood princes book he thought that the prince had a good sense of humour and that the book was essentially harmless occasionally he was jealous because the book helped harry cultivate the favour of professor slughorn but even after the incident ron called the prince a genius on the night of the battle of the astronomy tower ron took felix felicis on harrys instructions along with hermione and ginny those three were joined by neville and luna whom hermione had summoned using the da coins while hermione and luna monitored professor snapes office ron and the others watched the room of requirement ron fought in the battle and survived without any major injuries thanks to the felix felicis he was shaken by his oldest brother bills scarring at the hands of the vicious werewolf fenrir greyback shortly afterwards ron attended the funeral of albus dumbledore where he comforted a sobbing hermione he and hermione informed harry of their intention to accompany him on a quest to locate and destroy the horcruxes of lord voldemort forgoing their seventh year of school search for the horcruxes harry embracing ron and hermione after the battle of the seven potters in late july he participated in the orders operation to remove harry from his childhood home taking polyjuice potion to be one of the seven potters he flew with nymphadora tonks they were pursued by at least three death eaters during the battle including bellatrix and rodolphus lestrange ron stunned one death eater in the face while flying ron reassured hermione by nuzzling her back slightly upon landing as she had been quite worried about him and he was saddened at the death of madeye moody he was also saddened by the death of harrys beloved pet owl hedwig which he comforted harry over ron became concerned when harry had a vision of garrick ollivander being tortured by lord voldemort ron during the reading of albus dumbledores will once ron harry and hermione were all convened at the burrow they made plans to leave much to the displeasure of rons worried mother during the preparations for bills wedding mrs weasley set ron harry and hermione to separate tasks to prevent them from planning on harrys seventeenth birthday ron gave harry a copy of twelve failsafe ways to charm witches later that evening minister for magic rufus scrimgeour visited the burrow to dispense the contents of dumbledores will he questioned the trio and ron let slip that they had no idea why dumbledore would bequeath anything to him ron received dumbledores deluminator escape from the burrow ron watches out for mafalda hopkirk to arrive at the ministry there the trio learned from kreacher that regulus black had stolen the horcrux voldemort had made of salazar slytherins locket in and that it had been stolen from grimmauld place by mundungus fletcher under interrogation he informed them that the locket was now in the possession of dolores umbridge while they were waiting for kreacher to fetch mundungus they were visited by remus lupin he informed the trio about the goings on in the wider wizarding world he told them that harry was now the most wanted wizard in britain and that muggleborn witches and wizards were being rounded up ron immediately said that he would vouch for hermione they formulated a plan to infiltrate the ministry involving the use of polyjuice potion to assume the forms of ministry employees reginald cattermole albert runcorn and mafalda hopkirkron disguised as reginald cattermole quickly found himself forced to separate from his friends as death eater and new head of the department of magical law enforcement yaxley demanded that cattermole fix the rain in his office ron splinched in the escape from the ministry ron was in over his head but may have found a solution to the problem after asking arthur who had no idea of rons true identity for help the trio reunited after harry and hermione stole the locket from umbridge and freed some muggleborn witches and wizards being held by the muggleborn registration commission and then escaped but were forced to abandon grimmauld place as a hideout ron splinched himself during their escape into the countryside and was weakened by his injury after receiving some treatment from hermione ron fretted over the fate of the cattermoles departure and return ron leads the way to the lovegoods house upon his return ron was happy to the point of giddiness because he thought that they had an ally out there somewhere he sought to hide this happiness when around hermione in an act of contrition when hermione proposed a trip to the lovegoods house to investigate a recurring symbol ron wholeheartedly agreed harry privately accused ron of only agreeing to get back on hermiones good side a fact that he did not deny stating alls fair in love and war and this is a little bit of both the trio learned of the existence of the deathly hallows from xenophilius lovegood xenophilius worried for his daughter luna who was being held hostage by death eaters tried to capture the trio they narrowly escaped hermione engineering it in a way that preserved rons alibi of being sick at home while harry obsessed over the hallows ron and hermione thought they should focus on finding the horcruxes as dumbledore had instructed them during harrys period of listless obsession rons leadership qualities began to show he suggested that they search many wizarding settlements for clues if only to be in motion and actively searching skirmish at the malfoy manor on and hermione disguised as dragomir despard and bellatrix lestrange break into gringotts bank there hermione recovered and she ron and harry planned to break into gringotts wizarding bank in order to take helga hufflepuffs cup and a horcrux within the lestrange vault griphook the goblin agreed to help them in exchange for gryffindors sword ron knowing that the sword was needed to destroy horcruxes was reluctant to let harry part with it harry suggested that they delay handing the sword over until the horcruxes were destroyed as the planning went forward ron along with harry and hermione found griphook to be increasingly distasteful the trio escaping from gringotts on a dragons back on the morning of may they broke into gringotts with hermione disguised as bellatrix lestrange ron as a fictional foreign wizard named dragomir despard and harry under his invisibility cloak with griphook as they were headed down into the vaults the gringotts defences were set against them and rons disguise melted away once in the vault it was discovered that all the treasure had geminio and flagrante spells put on them although they were betrayed by griphook the trio obtained helga hufflepuffs cup and escaped the wizarding bank on the back of a dragon the battle of hogwarts ron at age ron never received a seventh year of education at hogwarts instead he moved on to become an auror along with harry at the ministry of magic their work in the ministry revolutionised the auror department and along with hermione they helped make a new world for the wizarding community two years after he started at the auror office he left to help his brother george at weasleys wizard wheezes on diagon alley his decision to do so was questioned by rita skeeter who thought that ron was tired of standing in harrys shadow and wrote in her gossip column that ron was likely mentally ill this must of course be taken with more than a small pinch of salt due to ritas habit of writing scathing and lies in articles having said himself that the horcrux hunt had took its toll on him sometime between and ron married hermione and the couple had two children rose and hugo ron is also the godfather and uncle of harry and ginnys oldest son at some point ron harry and hermione were all featured on chocolate frog cards for their accomplishments which ron considered his finest hour ron with his family ron hermione and their children rose and hugo all attended the final of the th quidditch world cup in the patagonian desert in july alongside harry ginny james albus teddy lupin neville hannah luna rolf bill fleur victoire and potentially others in august of ron obtained a muggle drivinglicense he also admitted putting a confundus charm on the muggle driving inspector because he had forgotten to use his wing mirror properly excusing this mistake because casting a supersensory charm would be more effective that year he and hermione sent their daughter off for her first year at hogwarts and ron encouraged rose to be sorted into gryffindor house and to beat scorpius malfoy in marks he hugged hugo gently ron also became close with harrys children one of whom james was his godson lily luna potter and rons son were close in age and good friends as were rons daughter and albus severus potter physical appearance ron weasley in ron inherited the typical weasley family traits fiery red hair and a freckled complexion when he becomes embarrassed his ears notably turn red he has blue eyes a long nose and is described as being very tall and lanky with big hands and feet in this way his stature is similar to those of his older brothers bill and percy rather than the stockier charlie and fred and george by the time he was ron was inches tall and weighed pounds his sister ginny once joked to romilda that ron had a pygmy puff tattoo though it is doubtful that the remark had any truth in it by when he was at the age of rita skeeter remarked on a daily prophet gossip column that his famous ginger hair appears to be thinning slightly personality and traits ron was often insecure about his own abilities when compared to his elder brothers and famous best friend however once that lessened a little bit he proved to be a powerful wizard in his own right wizards chess ron was extremely talented at chess it was he who taught harry how to play ron and harry often played wizards chess together when they had free time in his first year his logistic ability helped him hermione and harry play past professor mcgonagalls magically transfigured giant chessboard to get to the philosophers stone and prevent it being stolen by voldemort as a result he got fifty points for his house for the best played game of chess that hogwarts has seen these many years as dumbledore himself noted duelling he was more than capable in battle it is notable that he survived both the battle of the department of mysteries and the battle of the astronomy tower before this he fought well in the battle of the seven potters stunning a death eater while flying he also disarmed bellatrix lestrange and saved hermione during the skirmish at malfoy manor and took down fenrir greyback with neville longbottom and fought several other death eaters during the battle of hogwarts he survived the battle when his older brother fred did not he also escaped a group of snatchers unharmed after he temporarily left the horcrux hunt defence against the dark arts ron became adept at defence against the dark arts after having been trained in dumbledores army in he achieved an exceeds expectations grade on his owl exam his mastery of the stunning spell and the disarming charm spells taught during defence against the dark arts as well as his career as an auror both attest to his ability to competently defend himself against dark magic charms ron was rather good at this subject being able to cast a successful slugvomiting charm in only his second year and receiving an exceeds expectations on his owl exam he was also known to be able to adequately cast the confundus the supersensory and even the patronus charm by his fifth year the last of which is noted to be advanced magic not usually taught on the hogwarts curriculum he could also cast simplier charms such as the levitation charm wandlighting charm unlocking charm and various others potions ron was able to achieve an exceeds expectations grade on his owl exam he was one of only twelve students able to go on to newtlevel in showing proficiency in the subject transfiguration ron advanced to newtlevel and achieved an exceeds expectations on his owl exam showing aptitude in the subject he was also able to cast transforming spells for example the avifors spell and lapifors spell herbology ron achieved an exceeds expectations on his owl exam he attended newtlevel herbology in his sixth year he could also cast plant related charms such as the firemaking spell and the herbivicus charm nonverbal magic ron was able to stun a man who attempted to attack hermione in without saying the incantation he is also noted to have been able to achieve this at a young age as demonstrated in his second year when he attempted to curse draco when he insulted hermione the charm worked without him saying the incantation even though it backfired astronomy ron earned on owl in this subject its unknown if he was able to continue on to the newt class seeing as he didnt apply for advancement quidditch ron was a reasonably good keeper however his performance was inconsistent because of his lack of confidence tactical thinking ron was good with tactical thinking and showed a talent for thinking outside of the box for example it was ron who suggested that harry use felix felicis to try to get horace slughorns memory of telling tom riddle about the horcruxes and rons idea to go to the chamber of secrets in order to get basilisk fangs to destroy the horcruxes ron was also able to keep a level head in highly stressful situations and was generally more pragmatic than either of his best friends impersonation ron was clever at imitating voices while at malfoy manor he was able to convincingly imitate peter pettigrew to avoid arousing the suspicions of bellatrix and the malfoys he was also able to mimic parseltongue effectively which is a rather difficult language to learn or even imitate enough to open the chamber of secrets after previously hearing harry do it possessions the weasley family ron was quite close with his family although he was sometimes embarrassed by their lack of money ron was fiercely protective of his siblings and always stoutly defended his parents he was outraged when his brother percy called their father a failure and greatly upset their mother with his estrangement as ron was close to both of his parents ron looked up to his older brothers bill and charlie though their accomplishments also made him feel insecure about what he had to live up to percy tried to be a role model for ron but ron considered him rather pompous and annoying and took after fred and george more in terms of personality notably ron was the only family member percy contacted after his estrangement from his family and the one who comforted him over freds death during the battle of hogwarts the twins delighted in teasing ron as did his younger sister ginny though they were all close ron was very protective of ginny particularly in disapproving of her love life which sometimes led to them fighting other relatives of ron were fabian and gideon prewett who were his uncles and members of the order of the phoenix during the first wizarding war the brothers were attacked by five death eaters including antonin dolohov both were killed in battle and were described as having fought like heroes after the second wizarding war rons family was extended when four of his siblings were married and had children he also had two children with hermione granger rose and hugo weasley harry potter hermione granger his future wife and mother of his children rons relationship with hermione was rocky but by and large the two were good friends for most of their adolescence with building romantic tension that culminated in a kiss during the battle of hogwarts from the time ron first met hermione on the hogwarts express at the start of their first year he found her annoying for showing off and regularly reciting the schools rules his first thought was that he didnt want to be in her house and he groaned when she was sorted into gryffindor later on he informed others of his annoyance with her and mentioned that it was unsurprising that she didnt have any friends which she overheard hurt hermione hid in the bathroom crying until harry and ron saved her from a troll that had been let into hogwarts by professor quirrell following the troll incident hermione lied to professor mcgonagall to prevent harry and ron from getting into trouble from that time onwards the trio were best friends in spite of ron and hermiones tendency to bicker ron first began showing signs of romantic interest in hermione in their second year he was irritated by her crush on defence against the dark arts professor gilderoy lockhart became so angry that draco malfoy called her a mudblood that he tried to hex him and was even more upset than harry when she became one of the victims of the basilisk in their third year ron and hermione had their first real fight when ron accused hermiones cat crookshanks of eating his pet rat scabbers which had gone missing the two stopped speaking to each other for a time but made up after hagrid scolded ron and harry for their treatment of hermione ron offered to help her with buckbeaks trial and hermione hugged him also in their third year during their defence against the dark arts class when professor lupin was ill and professor snape was teaching instead ron was the only person that had enough courage to go as far as standing up to snape when he called hermione an insufferable knowitall in their fourth year ron and hermiones romantic feelings for one another began to grow and become more obvious hermione was jealous of rons crush on fleur delacour the partveela champion from beauxbatons and ron became jealous of viktor krum with whom hermione attended the yule ball after ron failed to ask hermione in time and then offended her with his clumsy attempt to do so though they rowed heatedly over hermione seeing krum their friendship only suffered slight strain hermiones frustration over rons failure to realise and act on his feelings continued into their fifth year as she commented that he had the emotional range of a teaspoon ron was visibly affected when hermione kissed him on the cheek before his first quidditch game and irked that hermione maintained a correspondence with viktor krum ron and hermione kiss in the chamber of secrets their sixth year would be a trying time for ron and hermione when hermione and harry were invited to the slug club while professor slughorn ignored ron ron became resentful and jealous he brightened up considerably after hermione asked him to go to slughorns christmas party with her however ron had a row with his sister after catching her snogging dean thomas during which she revealed that hermione had snogged viktor krum sometime during their fourth year ron started acting coldly towards hermione much to her bewilderment in an attempt to boost rons confidence for an upcoming quidditch match harry pretended to slip him some felix felicis in rons morning pumpkin juice giving ron the desired placebo effect that kept his nerves from hindering his performance as a keeper harry had managed to trick hermione into thinking he had given ron a drop of the felix felicis as well and she berated both harry and ron for taking an unfair advantage in the game though ron had initially believed the felix was behind his flawless performance when harry revealed he had not actually slipped anything in rons drink ron accused hermione of not having faith in his abilities and thenceforth started ignoring her completely all this caused ron to begin a shallow relationship with lavender brown hermione was hurt and furious conjuring a flock of canaries to attack ron after which the two did not speak for months hermione even retaliated by attending the aforementioned christmas party with cormac mclaggen an older gryffindor whom ron despised simply to annoy ron by this time ron was already growing tired of his relationship with the very clingy lavender when ron was accidentally poisoned with mead on his birthday hermione forgot her anger in her worry for him staying by his side until he recovered ron looked forward to these visits from her while pretending to be asleep whenever lavender visited him during one of lavenders visits ron repeated hermiones name in his sleep causing her to become very silent by the time ron was allowed to leave the hospital wing he and hermione were closer than ever and the formers romance with lavender ended quickly when lavender saw ron and hermione coming down from the boys dormitories together while harry was with them under his invisibility cloak at the end of the year their mutual affection was visible when ron gently comforted hermione as she cried on his shoulder at dumbledores funeral afterwards the two grew much closer though were only sort of together according to harry they danced together at bill and fleurs wedding where ron also showed his continuing jealous dislike of viktor krum who was a guest during the hunt for the horcruxes with harry ron comforted hermione several times by putting his arm around her and the two were generally kinder to one another harry even suspected that they had fallen asleep in grimmauld place holding hands after waking up and noticing that their hands were barely an inch away from each other hermione fell asleep handinhand in grimmauld place when remus lupin informed them of the ministrys crack down on muggleborns ron offered to vouch for her by telling people that hermione was his cousin at which hermione affectionately touched his hand and reminded him that they were on the run with the most wanted wizard in britain when ron temporarily left his friends hermione cried over him for weeks ron was able to return by hearing hermiones voice saying his name through his deluminator when ron destroyed the locket horcrux it taunted him with visions of his greatest fears one of which was hermione preferring harry to him hermione was initially furious with ron for his abandonment to the point of physically attacking him though she eventually forgave him later on when the trio was brought to malfoy manor bellatrix lestrange isolated hermione for interrogation by the means of torture ron begged in vain to be taken in her stead and after being thrown into the basement hermiones screams from above caused ron to call her name in anguish eventually reducing him to tears during the battle of hogwarts hermione was touched when ron expressed concern for the castles houseelves for whom she had always been concerned and initiated a kiss to which ron responded very enthusiastically sometime after the end of the second wizarding war ron and hermione married and had two children rose and hugo children after the second wizarding war ron had many nieces and nephews through his siblings bill and fleur had three children victoire dominique and louis percy and his wife audrey had two daughters molly after rons mother and lucy george and angelina had two children a son named fred after rons older brother and a daughter named roxanne ginny also married harry and had three children james to whom ron was godfather albus and lily fleur delacour neville longbottom a good friend neville longbottom became rons room mate in their first year at hogwarts neville was shy and nervous and regularly found himself being bullied by slytherin students like draco malfoy ron encouraged neville to be more confident and to stand up for himself and the two became close friends both ron and neville became members of dumbledores army in and fought together in the battle of the department of mysteries in and the battle of the astronomy tower in ron was shocked when he learned that nevilles parents were patients at st mungos hospital for magical maladies and injuries having been tortured to the point of insanity by barty crouch jr bellatrix rodolphus and rabastan lestrange and sympathised with his friend while ron harry and hermione left hogwarts to find voldemorts horcruxes neville led ginny weasley luna lovegood and several other students in reviving dumbledores army and maintaining a steady opposition against the new headmaster severus snape and professors amycus and alecto carrow neville was adamant that the rest of the da be included in whatever ron harry and hermione were doing to bring down lord voldemort and he fought together with them in the battle of hogwarts ultimately beheading nagini with the sword of gryffindor and destroying the last remaining horcrux together ron and neville took down fenrir greyback after the second wizarding war ron and neville remained close and saw each other regularly as neville was appointed herbology professor at hogwarts and taught rons daughter in draco malfoy luna lovegood a good friend ron met luna lovegood in on the hogwarts express and found her very odd she found him very funny but ron suspected she was making fun of him when she laughed uproariously at a joke he made after getting to know her better through dumbledores army ron gradually became fonder of luna especially after she was one of the only da members to come to the trios assistance when they ventured to the ministry of magic and a battle ensued during which luna protected a cursed ron and his injured sister ron was very amused when luna commentated on a quidditch match the following year and when she danced by herself at the wedding of his older brother bill and fleur delacour he thought highly of her bravery but still teased her on occasion regardless the two remained close friends in their adulthood seamus finnigan and dean thomas peter pettigrew scabbers was an unusually old and scragglylooking rat that originally belonged to percy weasley but was passed down to ron when percy was given hermes at first ron showed little outward affection for scabbers as the rat was uninteresting and one of rons many handmedowns however ron later demonstrated that he genuinely cared for the rat he was so devastated when scabbers disappeared during the school year that he nearly ended his friendship with hermione granger believing her cat crookshanks had eaten scabbers ron was clearly overjoyed when they later discovered scabbers hiding in rubeus hagrids cabin when sirius black and remus lupin revealed that scabbers was actually an animagus named peter pettigrew ron refused to believe it until they forced the rat to transform back into his human form ron took this revelation as a personal insult and refused to listen to pettigrews pleas for mercy in ron harry and hermione were captured and imprisoned in the cellar of malfoy manor when the houseelf dobby came to rescue them peter was sent to investigate the noise harry and ron ambushed pettigrew and ron took his wand harry reminded pettigrew of the lifedebt he owed harry when pettigrew tried to strangle him and peter momentarily loosened his grip however the silver hand given to peter by voldemort turned on him instead and despite harry and rons attempts to save him pettigrew was killed for showing the slightest bit of mercy ron subsequently gained possession of pettigrews wand this could be seen as poetic justice for pettigrew who had deceived ron for so long rubeus hagrid remus lupin previous defence against the dark arts professor ron was among the students who were very impressed by remus lupins teaching when he was professor of defence against the dark arts during rons third year at hogwarts though ron was initially afraid when he learned lupin was a werewolf he quickly realised that being a werewolf didnt change who lupin was in human form and the issue never came between them in when harry fought with remus for attempting to temporarily leave his pregnant wife to aid harry ron and hermione in their mission ron expressed his disappointment in the way harry handled the situation despite agreeing with the point harry was trying to make ron and lupin fought alongside each other in the battle of the department of mysteries the battle of the astronomy tower the battle of the seven potters the attack at the burrow and the battle of hogwarts where remus was killed by antonin dolohov after remus was killed in the second wizarding war ron remained close with remus son teddy lupin who was also harrys godson sirius black minerva mcgonagall his head of house and teacher minerva mcgonagall was the transfiguration professor and gryffindor head of house during rons time at hogwarts she was very strict and regularly reprimanded ron harry and hermione for the many instances they ended up bending or outright breaking school rules however she was just and impartial as a disciplinarian and always acted in the best interest of all hogwarts students often showing lenience and understanding where it was deserved she clearly cared about ron as she cared about all of her students and ron fought alongside mcgonagall during the battle of the astronomy tower and the battle of hogwarts both surviving the second wizarding war nymphadora tonks severus snape his teacher severus snape was the potions master and head of slytherin house during rons time at hogwarts he made no attempt to hide his preference for his own house nor his disdain for the gryffindor students and showed particular dislike for both ron and hermione as harrys best friends ron believed that snape who was a former death eater had never truly joined their side and that he was still working as a double agent for voldemort during his fifth year ron suggested that snape was trying to open harrys mind to voldemort rather than close it during harrys occlumency lessons in ron fought in the battle of the astronomy tower after which he learned that snape had killed albus dumbledore and a few months later during the battle of the seven potters snape accidentally cursed off george weasleys ear while aiming a sectumsempra at a death eater who was poised to kill remus lupin ron like most of the order and hogwarts staff viewed snape as a cowardly heartless murderer however ron witnessed snapes death as ordered by lord voldemort during the battle of hogwarts and eventually learned that snape had been working for their side all along at great personal risk it was likely that ron came to appreciate snapes unwavering bravery albus dumbledore lavender brown his exgirlfriend lavender brown a gryffindor in rons year developed a crush on him when they entered their sixth year at first ron seemed vaguely flattered but not particularly interested in lavenders flirtatious behaviour however after becoming angry with hermione and being taunted by ginny over his lack of romantic experience ron began an exhibitionist relationship with lavender the couple was frequently seen snogging in public much to the disgust of a jealous and hurt hermione as well as ginny who considered him a filthy hypocrite because he insulted her for being caught kissing her boyfriend earlier in the year lavender threw herself into the relationship almost obsessively alarming even her best friend parvati patil lavender called ron by the annoying nickname of wonwon pressed harry for details of rons feelings for her and gave him a necklace with the words my sweetheart for christmas ron found these traits irritating and admitted to harry that the relationship consisted of little talking and mostly snogging ron and lavender kissing or snogging by his birthday ron was unhappy in the relationship he feigned sleep whenever lavender visited him in the infirmary after his poisoning and said hermiones name in his sleep he was spared the task of breaking up with lavender when she became suspicious that something was going on between him and hermione and ended the romance ron was happy to see things finished though he felt guilty for it but lavender was upset for some time afterwards it is unknown how ron reacted to lavenders death in the battle of hogwarts viktor krum ron and pigwidgeon pigwidgeon became rons owl in he was given to ron by sirius black as sirius felt partially responsible for the loss of rons pet rat who turned out to be the animagus and death eater peter pettigrew in disguise pig as ron preferred to call him was tiny and hyperactive ron stated that pig annoyed the other owls such as errol and hermes and had to be kept away from them at school several girls commented on how cute pigwidgeon was to rons embarrassment though ron often seemed annoyed with pigs manic behaviour it was clear he loved him and enjoyed having an owl of his own crookshanks ron with cormac mclaggen his rival in rons competition for the keeper position on the gryffindor quidditch team was cormac mclaggen a gryffindor a year above him before the tryouts hermione overheard mclaggen insulting ron and ginny and placed a confundus charm on him that made him miss his last save ron thus beat him though mclaggen claimed that this was due to favouritism ron greatly disliked him which prompted hermione to attend professor slughorns christmas party with him to retaliate against ron for his romance with lavender brown ron disliked mclaggen even more and was happy when his date with hermione did not go well and when mclaggen did not perform well as replacement keeper while ron was in the hospital wing dolores umbridge nicholas de mimsyporpington rons lack of sensitivity causes him to be unpopular with the hogwarts ghosts namely nearly headless nick and moaning myrtle ron first met nearly headless nick in during his first welcoming feast he knew nick because he heard fred and george talking about him nick requested that ron should address him as sir nicholas instead of nearly headless nick during later feasts ron would annoy nick by reminding him he was dead and how much he enjoyed food ron met moaning myrtle in during the reopening of the chamber of secrets myrtle was upset since ginny had unknowingly thrown a diary at her ron pointed out that it couldnt hurt myrtle since she was a ghost and the book would go through her myrtle swooped down on ron with rage and sarcastically commented that everyone should throw books at her and make a game out of it lord voldemort dumbledores army dumbledores army was an organisation led by harry potter in order to oppose dolores umbridge and as a supplementary means of practising defensive magic in ron and hermione convinced harry to teach anyone who was interested about protective spells and counterjinxes that had helped him survive his many encounters with voldemort as the purely theoretical instruction they were receiving from umbridge was wholly inadequate six members of the da fought in the battle of the department of mysteries in addition to harry potter hermione granger ginny weasley fred and george neville longbottom luna lovegood lavender brown seamus finnigan and dean thomas there were eighteen other known members the gryffindor students who were members of the da included colin and dennis creevey parvati patil lee jordanfred and george weasleys best friend alicia spinnet and katie bellmembers of the gryffindor quidditch team and angelina johnson captain of the team and rons future sisterinlaw after marrying george fred and colin creevey were both killed by death eaters in during the battle the hufflepuff students were hannah abbott ernie macmillan susan bones justin finchfletchley and zacharias smith ron was friendly with all of them except zacharias the only one who didnt fight in the battle of hogwarts the ravenclaw students were padma patil parvatis twin sister cho chang terry boot anthony goldstein michael corner and marietta edgecombe ron attended the yule ball with padma who wasnt pleased with rons appearance in his tattered dress robes and ron wasnt particularly fond of michael corner who was ginnys exboyfriend they all fought together during the battle of hogwarts in with the exception of marietta who did not return to hogwarts at any point order of the phoenix the original order of the phoenix the order of the phoenix was an organisation founded and led by albus dumbledore the order included rons family harry potter hermione granger rubeus hagrid remus lupin sirius black fleur delacour minerva mcgonagall nymphadora tonks and severus snape as well as several other notable members of the wizarding community in for rons fourth year at hogwarts alastor mad eye moody an auror famous for his great skill vast experience and growing paranoia was appointed professor of defence against the dark arts prior to the start of the school year on lord voldemorts orders moody was attacked and imprisoned in his own magical trunk by barty crouch jr who impersonated moody and took his place at hogwarts by using polyjuice potion until june ron clearly held moody in high regard as he looked forward to his classes and persistently hoped that moody would tell him he would make a good auror as he had harry and hermione albeit it was actually barty crouch jr who suggested harry and hermione consider becoming aurors ron met the real madeye later in at grimmauld place the headquarters of the order ron and moody fought alongside one another in the battle of the department of mysteries and in the battle of the seven potters where madeye was killed ron like the other members of the order was shocked and devastated by the death of someone as tough and skilled as moody ron was also familiar with the useless git mundungus fletcher an almost grudging member of the order though ron was initially amused by mundungus he quickly grew disgusted with mundungus continued general disregard for other people or their property and safety particularly when he abandoned alastor moody in the midst of the battle of the seven potters ron met mundungus again when he harry and hermione wanted information regarding the whereabouts of salazar slytherins locket and appeared amused by kreachers repeated abuse of fletcher when ron harry and hermione apparated into hogsmeade intent on sneaking into hogwarts to find an object that had once belonged to rowena ravenclaw they found themselves in a trap set by death eaters they were saved by aberforth dumbledore albus dumbledores younger brother and owner of the hogs head they discovered that they had been saved by him once before it was aberforth who had sent dobby to rescue them from the malfoy manor after harry saw his eye in the remaining shard of sirius twoway mirror they were later also informed by neville that aberforth had been supporting neville and the other da members remaining at hogwarts by feeding them passing messages using enchanted coins and generally backing them in their resistance against severus snape and the carrows other order members ron encountered were kingsley shacklebolt a skilled auror who would later go on to become minister for magic and who was greatly admired by ron harry hermione and the weasleys elphias doge albus dumbledores friend as well as dedalus diggle hestia jones sturgis podmore and emmeline vance emmeline vance was killed by death eaters in and podmore was imprisoned because he attempted to get into the department of mysteries under the imperius curse the news of which shocked and horrified ron it is likely that every surviving member of the order except arabella figg who was a squib and unable to fight but might have helped in another way fought in

are no longer in restructuring there are still outstanding items that will require the judges review from time to time and the court maintains jurisdiction over some matters but yes we emerged from bankruptcy when we closed the merger on december does merger close mean american and us airways are one airline not yet were one company but still very much running two separate airlines until we

to date on a wide variety of health topics sign up now statin side effects weigh the benefits and risksstatin side effects can be uncomfortable making it seem like the risks outweigh the benefits of these powerful cholesterollowering medications consider the risks and benefits by mayo clinic staff doctors often prescribe statins for people with high cholesterol to lower their total cholesterol and reduce their risk of a heart attack or stroke most people taking statins will take them for the rest of their lives unless they can achieve normal cholesterol levels through diet exercise weight loss and nutritional supplements this can make statin side effects more difficult to manage for some people statin side effects can make it seem like the benefit of taking a statin isnt worth it before you decide to stop taking a statin discover how statin side effects can be reduced what are statin side effects muscle pain and damage the most common statin side effect is muscle pain you may feel this pain as a soreness tiredness or weakness in your muscles the pain can be a mild discomfort or it can be severe enough to make your daily activities difficult for example you might find climbing stairs or walking to be uncomfortable or tiring very rarely statins can cause lifethreatening muscle damage called rhabdomyolysis rabdoemiolihsis rhabdomyolysis can cause severe muscle pain liver damage kidney failure and death rhabdomyolysis can occur when you take statins in combination with certain drugs or if you take a high dose of statins liver damage occasionally statin use could cause your liver to increase its production of enzymes that help you digest food drinks and medications if the increase is only mild you can continue to take the drug rarely if the increase is severe you may need to stop taking the drug your doctor might suggest a different statin certain other cholesterollowering drugs such as gemfibrozil lopid and niacin niacor niaspan slightly increase the risk of liver problems in people who take statins although liver problems are rare your doctor will likely order a liver enzyme test before or shortly after you begin to take a statin you shouldnt need any additional liver enzyme tests unless you begin to have signs or symptoms of trouble with your liver contact your doctor immediately if you have unusual fatigue or weakness loss of appetite pain in your upper abdomen darkcolored urine or yellowing of your skin or eyes digestive problems some people taking a statin may develop nausea gas diarrhea or constipation after taking a statin these side effects are rare most people who have these side effects already have other problems with their digestive system taking your statin medication in the evening with a meal can reduce digestive side effects rash or flushing you could develop a rash or flushing after you start taking a statin if you take a statin and niacin either in a combination pill such as simcor or as two separate medications youre more likely to have this side effect taking aspirin before taking your statin medication may help but talk to your doctor first increased blood sugar or type diabetes its possible your blood sugar blood glucose level may increase when you take a statin which may lead to developing type diabetes the risk is small but important enough that the food and drug administration fda has issued a warning on statin labels regarding blood glucose levels and diabetes talk to your doctor if you have concerns neurological side effects the fda warns on statin labels that some people have developed memory loss or confusion while taking statins these side effects reverse once you stop taking the medication talk to your doctor if you experience memory loss or confusion there has also been evidence that statins may help with brain function mdash in patients with dementia or alzheimers for example this is still being studied dont stop taking your statin medication before talking to your doctor whos at risk of developing statin side effects not everyone who takes a statin will have side effects but some people may be at a greater risk than are others risk factors include taking multiple medications to lower your cholesterol being female having a smaller body frame being age or older having kidney or liver disease having type or diabetes drinking too much alcohol more than two drinks a day for men age and younger and more than one drink a day for women of all ages and men older than what causes statin side effects its unclear what causes statin side effects especially muscle pain statins work by slowing your bodys production of cholesterol your body produces all the cholesterol it needs by digesting food and producing new cells on its own when this natural production is slowed your body begins to draw the cholesterol it needs from the food you eat lowering your total cholesterol statins may affect not only your livers production of cholesterol but also several enzymes in muscle cells that are responsible for muscle growth the effects of statins on these cells may be the cause of muscle aches next sharetweet apr references fernandez g et al statin myopathy a common

cholesterol has improved care for many people most people who have diabetes or those who have had a stroke or heart attack benefit from lower cholesterol levels medications called ldquostatinsrdquo are the most commonly prescribed drugs used to reduce cholesterol some examples of statin medications are lipitorreg atorvastatin pravacholreg pravastatin zocorreg simvastatin livaloreg pitavastatin and crestorreg rosuvastatin unfortunately some people may experience muscle pain or weakness while taking statins the pain may be minor such as soreness or stiffness however muscle pain particularly if severe and accompanied by darkcolored urine may be an indication of a more serious lifethreatening problem called rhabdomyolysis older age and a low body weight are risk factors for developing statininduced muscle pain both the medication dose and the fact that it might be interacting with other medicines a person takes can cause the side effect of muscle pain people who take statins and drink large quantities of grapefruit juice may be at increased risk for muscular side effects people with liver and thyroid problems may also develop muscle pain while taking statins finally new research indicates that genetics may play a role in determining who may develop muscle pain with statins often people may experience muscle pain or discomfort when starting a statin but usually these symptoms improve after the first few weeks on the medicine but itrsquos important to remember that muscle pain may develop even if you have been taking a statin for years if you experience muscle pain while taking a statin contact your health care provider he or she will likely do a physical exam and check your bloodwork both of these tests are important to determine if the statin medication is causing the problem if your doctor feels that the statin is contributing to the problem you probably will be asked to stop the medication to see if your symptoms improve sometimes during this ldquostatin holidayrdquo your doctor may ask you to take coenzyme q lcarnitine or fish oil however current research does not clearly show that these supplements are helpful for treating statininduced muscle pain if your muscle pain improves you and your health care team can decide whether it is acceptable for you to remain off of a statin or whether you need to continue this type of medication sometimes your doctor will prescribe a different kind of medication to treat high cholesterol instead of a statin however when the decision is made to continue taking a statin trying a different statin may work it is also important to make sure that you are not taking medications that interact with the statin as this can increase the risk of the muscle pain side effect statin medications have made it possible for many people to live longer and healthier lives but it is important to pay attention to any muscle discomfort you experience while taking these drugs even if muscle stiffness weakness and pain are minor while you are taking a statin it is important that you discuss these symptoms with your doctor and your pharmacist thatrsquos because these symptoms may be related to your

Query:Hubble oldest star
Page:nasa home missions hubble sciencesendprintfollow this link to share this pagesharefeaturetext sizegrow text sizeshrink text size hubble finds birth certificate of oldest known star rsaquo view larger this is a digitized sky survey image of the oldest star with a welldetermined age in our galaxy the aging star cataloged as hd lies lightyears away the angloaustralian observatory aao uk schmidt telescope photographed the star in blue light credit digitized sky survey dss stsciaura palomarcaltech and ukstuaao a team of astronomers using nasas hubble space telescope has taken an important step closer to finding the birth certificate of a star thats been around for a very long time we have found that this is the oldest known star with a welldetermined age said howard bond of pennsylvania state university in university park pa and the space telescope science institute in baltimore md the star could be as old as billion years plus or minus billion years which at first glance would make it older than the universes calculated age of about billion years an obvious dilemma but earlier estimates from observations dating back to placed the star as old as billion years and this age range presented a potential dilemma for cosmologists maybe the cosmology is wrong stellar physics is wrong or the stars distance is wrong bond said so we set out to refine the distance the new hubble age estimates reduce the range of measurement uncertainty so that the stars age overlaps with the universes age as independently determined by the rate of expansion of space an analysis of the microwave background from the big bang and measurements of radioactive decay this methuselah star cataloged as hd has been known about for more than a century because of its fast motion across the sky the high rate of motion is evidence that the star is simply a visitor to our stellar neighborhood its orbit carries it down through the plane of our galaxy from the ancient halo of stars that encircle the milky way and will eventually slingshot back to the galactic halo this conclusion was bolstered by the s astronomers who were able to measure a deficiency of heavier elements in the star as compared to other stars in our galactic neighborhood the halo stars are among the first inhabitants of our galaxy and collectively represent an older population from the stars like our sun that formed later in the disk this means that the star formed at a very early time before the universe was largely polluted with heavier elements forged inside stars through nucleosynthesis the methuselah star has an anemic th as much of the heavy element content of our sun and other stars in our solar neighborhood the star which is at the very first stages of expanding into a red giant can be seen with binoculars as a thmagnitude object in the constellation libra hubbles observational prowess was used to refine the distance to the star which comes out to be lightyears bond and his team performed this measurement by using trigonometric parallax where an apparent shift in the position of a star is caused by a change in the observers position the results are published in the february issue of the astrophysical journal letters the parallax of nearby stars can be measured by observing them from opposite points in earths orbit around the sun the stars true distance from earth can then be precisely calculated through straightforward triangulation once the true distance is known an exact value for the stars intrinsic brightness can be calculated knowing a stars intrinsic brightness is a fundamental prerequisite to estimating its age before the hubble observation the european space agencys hipparcos satellite made a precise measurement of the stars parallax but with an age measurement uncertainty of billion years one of hubbles three fine guidance sensors measured the position of the methuselah star it turns out that the stars parallax came out to be virtually identical to the hipparcos measurements but hubbles precision is five times better that than of hipparcos bonds team managed to shrink the uncertainty so that the age estimate was five times more precise with a better handle on the stars brightness bonds team refined the stars age by applying contemporary theories about the stars burn rate chemical abundances and internal structure new ideas are that leftover helium diffuses deeper into the core and so the star has less hydrogen to burn via nuclear fusion this means it uses fuel faster and that correspondingly lowers the age also the star has a higher than predicted oxygentoiron ratio and this too lowers the age bond thinks that further oxygen measurement could reduce the stars age even more because the star would have formed at a slightly later time when the universe was richer in oxygen abundance lowering the upper age limit would make the star unequivocally younger than the universe put all of those ingredients together and you get an age of billion years with a residual uncertainty that makes the stars age compatible with the age of the universe said bond this is the best star in the sky to do precision age calculations by virtue of its closeness and brightness this methuselah star has seen many changes over its long life it was likely born in a primeval dwarf galaxy the dwarf galaxy eventually was gravitationally shredded and sucked in by the emerging milky way over billion years ago the star retains its elongated orbit from that cannibalism event therefore its just passing through the solar neighborhood at a rocketlike speed of miles per hour it takes just years to traverse a piece of sky with the angular width of the full moon the stars proper motion angular rate is so fast milliarcseconds an hour that hubble could actually photograph its movement in literally a few hours the hubble space telescope is a project of international cooperation between nasa and the european space agency nasas goddard

birth certificate of oldest known star introduction the full story release images fast facts related links go to image download page march you cant be older than your parents but there is a nearby star that at first glance looks like it is older than the universe hubble space telescope astronomers are coming to grips with this paradox by improving the precision of the observations used to estimate the age of this methuselah star around the year estimates for the stars age were about billion years but the universe is about billion years old based on a meticulous calibration of the expansion of space and analysis of the microwave afterglow from the big bang hubble data and improved theoretical calculations were used to recalculate the stars age and lower the estimate to billion years within a measurement uncertainty of plus or minus million years this places the star within a comfortable range to be younger than the universe astronomers have to collect a lot of information to deduce a stars age because it doesnt come with a birth certificate they have to take into account where the star is in its life history the detailed chemistry of the star and its intrinsic brightness hubbles contribution was to reduce the uncertainty on the stars true distance with that improved accuracy the intrinsic brightness of the star is better known the ancient star is still spry for its age it is speeding past us at miles per hour its orbit can be traced back to the halo of our galaxy which is a retirement home for stars that were born long before the milky way was even fully

oldest known star mar astronomy amp spaceastronomy full size imagethis is a digitized sky survey image of the oldest star with a welldetermined age in our galaxy the aging star cataloged as hd lies lightyears away the angloaustralian observatory uk schmidt telescope photographed the star in blue light credit digitized sky survey dss stsciaura palomarcaltech and ukstuaaophysorg a team of astronomers using nasas hubble space telescope has taken an important step closer to finding the birth certificate of a star thats been around for a very long time we have found that this is the oldest known star with a welldetermined age said howard bond of pennsylvania state university in university park pa and the space telescope science institute in baltimore md the star could be as old as billion years plus or minus billion years which at first glance would make it older than the universes calculated age of about billion years an obvious dilemma but earlier estimates from observations dating back to placed the star as old as billion years and this age range presented a potential dilemma for cosmologists maybe the cosmology is wrong stellar physics is wrong or the stars distance is wrong bond said so we set out to refine the distance the new hubble age estimates reduce the range of measurement uncertainty so that the stars age overlaps with the universes ageas independently determined by the rate of expansion of space an analysis of the microwave background from the big bang and measurements of radioactive decay this methuselah star cataloged as hd has been known about for more than a century because of its fast motion across the sky the high rate of motion is evidence that the star is simply a visitor to our stellar neighborhood its orbit carries it down through the plane of our galaxy from the ancient halo of stars that encircle the milky way and will eventually slingshot back to the galactic halo full size imagethis is an illustration of the oldest star ever found in our solar neighborhood the aging star cataloged as hd lies lightyears from earth hubble space telescope observations narrowed the measurement uncertainty on the stars distance and this helped refine the calculation of a more precise age of billion years plus or minus million years because the aging star is relatively nearby familiar stars and constellations as seen from earth are in the sky but in different locations at upper left is the constellation orion which looks distorted from our new perspective in space just to the upper left of the foreground star is the pleiades cluster to the lower left of the cluster our sun has dimmed to an apparent magnitude of placing it below nakedeye visibility credit nasa esa and a feild and f summers stscithis conclusion was bolstered by the s astronomers who were able to measure a deficiency of heavier elements in the star as compared to other stars in our galactic neighborhood the halo stars are among the first inhabitants of our galaxy and collectively represent an older population from the stars like our sun that formed later in the disk this means that the star formed at a very early time before the universe was largely polluted with heavier elements forged inside stars through nucleosynthesis the methuselah star has an anemic th as much of the heavy element content of our sun and other stars in our solar neighborhood the star which is at the very first stages of expanding into a red giant can be seen with binoculars as a thmagnitude object in the constellation libra hubbles observational prowess was used to refine the distance to the star which comes out to be lightyears bond and his team performed this measurement by using trigonometric parallax where an apparent shift in the position of a star is caused by a change in the observers position the results are published in the february issue of the astrophysical journal letters the parallax of nearby stars can be measured by observing them from opposite points in earths orbit around the sun the stars true distance from earth can then be precisely calculated through straightforward triangulation once the true distance is known an exact value for the stars intrinsic brightness can be calculated knowing a stars intrinsic brightness is a fundamental prerequisite to estimating its age before the hubble observation the european space agencys hipparcos satellite made a precise measurement of the stars parallax but with an age measurement uncertainty of billion years one of hubbles three fine guidance sensors measured the position of the methuselah star it turns out that the stars parallax came out to be virtually identical to the hipparcos measurements but hubbles precision is five times better that than of hipparcos bonds team managed to shrink the uncertainty so that the age estimate was five times more precise with a better handle on the stars brightness bonds team refined the stars age by applying contemporary theories about the stars burn rate chemical abundances and internal structure new ideas are that leftover helium diffuses deeper into the core and so the star has less hydrogen to burn via nuclear fusion this means it uses fuel faster and that correspondingly lowers the age also the star has a higher than predicted oxygentoiron ratio and this too lowers the age bond thinks that further oxygen measurement could reduce the stars age even more because the star would have formed at a slightly later time when the universe was richer in oxygen abundance lowering the upper age limit would make the star unequivocally younger than the universe put all of those ingredients together and you get an age of billion years with a residual uncertainty that makes the stars age compatible with the age of the universe said bond this is the best star in the sky to do precision age calculations by virtue of its closeness and brightness this methuselah star has seen many changes over its long life it was likely born in a primeval dwarf galaxy the dwarf galaxy eventually was gravitationally shredded and sucked in by the emerging milky way over billion years ago the star retains its elongated orbit from that cannibalism event therefore its just passing through the solar neighborhood at a rocketlike speed of miles per hour it takes just years to traverse a piece of sky with the angular width of the full moon the stars proper motion angular rate is so fast milliarcseconds an hour that hubble could actually photograph its movement in literally a few hoursprovided by

a mercenary scheme to name winter storms is not among the most important things in the news or even the weather but like an ill wind it carries an unmistakable whiff of chaos and dissipationthe system for naming hurricanes and tropical storms was developed over decades to facilitate communications about weather patterns that can endanger large swaths of the planet storms must reach sustained winds of at least mph before they earn a name from one of several rotating lists established by an international committee of the un world meteorological organization in genevaofficials even have a deliberate procedure to retire the names of the most damaging storms once a yearand then we have the weather channels socalled system for naming certain winter storms which looks to have been developed by the marketing staff in a fluorescentlit meeting room somewhere deep within its offices off an atlantaarea highway interchangethe channels comically vague explanation of its process says it will assess several variables before naming noteworthy storms including whether they affect rush hour the alleged benefits presented by the network include ease of hashtagging on twitterthis isnt much of a bid for gravitas and the weather channels choice of storm names doesnt help a good portion of its list including gandolf khan rocky and yogi consists of names closely associated with characters from science fiction popular movies and cartoonsthe weather channel announced its unilateral venture back in the fall whereupon the national weather service warned its meteorologists not to dignify the networks first winter storm designation athena with a mentionunfortunately though the gimmick started to gain traction with the noreaster that dumped snow on new york and new england this month public officials and others particularly on social media began joining the channels hype machine in calling the storm nemo a name irrevocably bound to an animated clownfish sorry jules verneat least the new regime replaces the channels previous ad hoc efforts to name snowstorms eg snowtober which were even worse but its still a depressing attempt to disguise empty hype as empirical analysishow long can it be before this pseudoscientific system mutates to encompass even more unremarkable weather patterns we might as well brace ourselves for heat wave lebron or stiff breeze bieberas impending winter storm nemo approaches and strikes the east coast social media sites mostly twitter are abuzz with commentary naming winter storms is a new phenomenon which the weather channel started doing this season the channel thought names for winter storms would catch the publics attention much like the captivation over hurricanes katrina and sandy as you can see from the tweets below not everyone was amused by this strategy the fact that this storm supposedly answers to the name nemo has caused even more stir than usual given that we associate the name nemo with the disneypixar clownfish with the gimpy fin many in the twittersphere have spoofed quotes from the movie or declared their plans to watch finding nemo in spirit of the storm while they are stuck inside others have also spent their time while snowed in making gifs of the impending nemo buzzfeed also created its own pictoral representation of how to make it through the storm finding nemo style some tweeps however had food on their mind when confronted with the blizzard whatever our social media reaction were all bracing for this noreaster thats sure to be more aggressive than our lovable clownfish friend despite punxatawney phils prediction of an early spring it looks like we have a few more days of winter at least stay warm and hope for days off from school like us on facebook share

naming a storm raises awareness attaching a name makes it much easier to follow a weather system s progress a storm with a name takes on a personality all its own which adds to awareness in todayrsquos social media world a name makes it much easier to reference a storm in communication a named storm is easier to remember and refer to in the future quotthe fact is a storm with a name is easier to follow which will mean fewer surprises and more preparationquot the network added however meteorologists are generally not impressed with this particular designation weather expert jason samenow with the washington post has collected the opinions of several of the scientists and the reactions are generally negative primarily meteorologists criticize the unilateral way the network made the decision apparently never consulting with the nws or professional organizations several respondents said this action will confuse the public and the media quoti think the preemptive decision by twc to begin naming winter storms is at best a poor decision by a critical source of weather information and at worst a gimmickquot writes wjla meteorologist bob ryan on his network s website quoti call this a preemptive decision because there was from everything i have learned no coordination of this decision to name winter storms with the national weather service or any of the professional groupsquot the nws chooses not to name snowstorms because unlike hurricanes and tropical storms they aren t welldefined storms following a path that can be tracked among other reasons said jeff weber a climatologist at the university corporation for atmospheric research in boulder colo weber added that he understands the rationale for the naming and that publicity was likely a prime motivation quotit makes sense to keep the public informed but i must admit i questioned the wisdom of having a commercial organization doing the namingquot he told ouramazingplanet the name nemo isn t meant to refer to quotfinding nemoquot bryan norcross a twc meteorologist who helped conceive the stormnaming last year told the new york times nemo is latin for quotno onequot or quotno manquot it also refers

miles south of islip new york you can track the data for yourself at this link herefriday pmeven before the first snowflake appeared todays blizzard has drawn dismissive comparisons usually from baby boomers and their elders with the blizzard of lousy inches theyll inevitably begin thats nothing why back in if this discoera comparison isnt enough to blacken your mood ring just wait for the stories about the gas shortages of cnn reports that gas lines are stretching for blocks in the new york area alarming as they may appear these gas lines arent a signal of any prolonged shortage says cnn but rather a result of bad memories of superstorm sandy when fuel supplies ran low in many parts of new york and new jersey indeed the storm will keep lots of cars off the roads this weekend likely resulting in a very groovy surplus so dont expect president obama to don a cardigan any time soon friday pmthe monitors pete spotts reports that the national weather service which had predicted to inches of snowfall has now revised its forecast to more than inches the reason slight changes in the tracks of the storm systems along with a mass of cold air behind one of them friday pmboston mayor

connections through some of the nations busiest airports the most affected airports include biggies like jfk and laguardia in new york city as well as the airports in newark nj boston and hartford conn with the possibility of two feet of snow or more falling in two days coupled with high winds the storm prompted airlines to act preemptively rather than wait until operations bog downas of am friday the tracking website flightaware shows canceled flights in the us for friday and another for saturday with the likelihood the tally will keep growingfor friday cancellations include more than

online in most cases well waive your change feesother airlines offer similar weather waivers that doesnt mean it will necessarily be easy for travelers to navigate around the storm but it at least makes it a bit less punishing on the pocketbookupdated friday amwhats a blizzardthe american meteorological society and the national weather service say that to call a storm a blizzard three conditions must exist for at least hours winds in excess of mph considerable falling or blowing snow visibilities of less than milewind is the ingredient that makes this storm more that just a big snowstorm and in this case there are forecasters who are expecting wind gusts to exceed mph or as kevin lemanowicz the chief meteorologist for bostons fox tv news station put it we should see wind gusts above hurricane strengththe national weather service defines hurricane force winds as those in excess of mphthose wind gusts will likely produce snow drifts as large as to feet high in the

in the western news media as western education is forbidden is a militant islamist movement based in northeast nigeria which seeks to establish an islamic state membership is estimated to number between a few hundred and a few thousand the group has received training and funds from alqaeda in the islamic maghreb and was designated by the us department of state as a terrorist organisation in november boko haram killed more than civilians between july and june including at least in the first half of alone people had fled their homes by august an increase of since may corruption and mismanagement in the nigerian security forces and human rights abuses committed by them have hampered efforts to counter the unrest kano nigeria was governed by a series of ruthless military dictatorships from its independence in until the advent of democracy in ethnic militancy is thought to have been one of the causes of the civil war religious violence reached a new height in in kano the largest city in the north of the country where the muslim fundamentalist sect yan tatsine followers of maitatsine instigated riots that resulted in casualties in the ensuing military crackdown maitatsine was killed causing a backlash of increased violence which spread among other northern cities over the course of the next years mohammed yusuf founded the sect that became known as boko haram in in maiduguri the capital of the northeastern state of borno establishing a religious complex with a school which attracted poor muslim families from across nigeria and neighbouring countries the center had the political goal of creating an islamic state and became a recruiting ground for jihadis by denouncing the police and state corruption yusuf attracted followers from unemployed youths he is reported to have used the existing infrastructure in borno of the izala society jamaat izalatil bidiawa iqamatus sunnah a popular conservative islamic sect to recruit members before breaking away to form his own faction the izala were originally welcomed into government along with people sympathetic to yusuf the local jamiat ululama council of theologians advised the government and the nigerian television authority not to broadcast yusufs preaching but their warnings were ignored yusufs arrests elevated him to hero status deputy governor of borno alhaji adamu dibal commented that yusuf was mystified to be a messiah according to the deputy governor al qaeda had had ties with boko haram but broke them when they decided that yusuf was an unreliable person the violence of boko haram can also be seen as being linked to the militancy of the arewa peoples congress the militia wing of the arewa consultative forum the main political group representing the interests of northern nigeria captain sagir mohammed a retired military intelligence officer and cofounder of the apc has stated we believe we have the capacity the willpower to go to any part of nigeria to protect our northern brothers in distress if it becomes necessary if we have to use violence we have to use it to save our people if it means jihad we will launch our jihad deprivation and inequality and the increasingly radical nature of islam both locally and internationally beginning with the ayatollah khomeini revolution in iran all contributed both to the maitatsine and the boko haram uprisings local politicians in nigeria have the authority to grant indigeneship which has farreaching consequences determining whether citizens can participate in politics own land work or attend school the system has been widely abused for political gain and has been a major cause of riots with both ethnic and religious dimensions in which hundreds or thousands were killed and tens of thousands forced to flee their homes for example in zangonkataf in and in jos in and boko haram conducted its operations more or less peacefully during the first seven years of its existence withdrawing from society into remote northeastern areas in following reports that the group were arming themselves the police launched an investigation codenamed operation flush prior to that the government had repeatedly ignored warnings about the increasingly militant character of the organization on july security forces arrested nine boko haram members and confiscated weapons and bombmaking equipment either this or a clash with police during a funeral procession led to revenge attacks on police by the end of the unrest on july more than people mostly boko haram members had been killed and police stations prisons government offices schools and churches had been destroyed yusuf was arrested and died in custody while trying to escape he was succeeded as leader by abubakar shekau formerly his secondincommand a classified cable sent from the us embassy abuja in november stated that borno political and religious leaders asserted that the state and federal government responded appropriately and apart from the opposition party overwhelmingly supported yusufs death without misgivings over the extrajudicial killing the northeast remained vulnerable to violence and extremist attacks due to lack of employment

international and human rights watch released detailed reports in widely quoted by us and uk government agencies and in the international media based on research conducted over the course of the conflict in the worst affected regions of the country the ngos were critical of the actions of both boko haram and government security forces hrw said boko haram should immediately cease all attacks and threats of attacks that cause loss of life injury and destruction of property the nigerian government should take urgent measures to address the human rights abuses that have helped fuel the

ansaru as terrorist organisations in november citing various reasons including links with aqim thousands of deaths in northeast and central nigeria over the last several years including targeted killings of civilians and ansarus kidnapping and execution of seven international construction workers in the statement from the department it was noted however these designations are an important and appropriate step but only one tool in what must be a comprehensive approach by the nigerian government to counter these groups through a combination of law enforcement political and development efforts sic boko haram is not currently june believed by the us government to be affiliated to al qaeda the nigerian military is in the words of a former british military attach speaking in a shadow

than a third of the security budget of billion but only is allocated to capital spending in a us dod assessment funds are being skimmed off the top troops are showing signs of real fear and are afraid to even engage boko haram gets funding from bank robberies and kidnapping ransoms in february recently arrested officials revealed that while the organization initially relied on donations from members its links with alqaeda in the islamic maghreb opened it up to funding from groups in saudi arabia and the uk the group also extorts local governments a spokesman of boko haram claimed that kano state governor ibrahim shekarau and bauchi state governor isa yuguda had paid them monthly in the past nigerian officials have been criticized for being unable to trace much of the funding that boko haram has received james cockayne formerly codirector of the center on global counterterrorism cooperation and senior fellow at the international peace institute wrote in given their appreciation of the contested nature of much african governance it comes as something of a surprise that carrier and klantschnig review of africa and the war on drugs fiercely downplay the impact that cocaine trafficking is having on west african governance on the basis of just three case studies guineabissau lesotho and nigeria the authors conclude that state complicity in the african drug trade is rare and the dominant paradigm is repression as a result they radically understate the close involvement of political and military actors in drug trafficking particularly in west african cocaine

Query:Tiger Woods regains title
Page:new posts posts this hour most popular highestpaid athletes lists americas top colleges video country cash kings comment now with his twostroke win at the arnold palmer invitational at the bay hill club in orlando florida tiger woods has regained the number one ranking in golf its a position he abdicated in october after a year of troubles due to his failed marriage and various leg injuries woods won palmers tournament for a record th time his ascendancy to the number one spot will add to his record number of weeks at the top of the golf world by the end of this week he will have spent weeks in the number one position the ranking is a testimony to how well woods has played in the last calendar year winning six tournaments during that span the milemarker must be somewhat satisfying to him given the dark and stormy period that he has weathered since november of his ranking had fallen as far as number back in november of no one has dominated the official world golf rankingswhich began in like woods has his nearest competitor in terms of weeks at the top is greg norman who spent weeks there woods once spent consecutive weeks at the top also a record when he fell from the top spot in october it ended an uninterrupted streak that began in june of woods now owns pga tour wins second only to sam sneads record of despite losing sponsors like gillette and tag heuer in the wake of his late troubles woods remains the third highestpaid athlete in the world and the worlds highestpaid golfer making an estimated million last year thanks mainly to nike and his tournament winnings i dont want to become as good as i once was no i dont woods said recently when asked about regaining his once dominate play i want to become better rankings aside he is without a doubt the best golfer in the world right now but in the end none of this really matters the number one ranking is fairly meaningless at least to woods and his quest for history from the beginning of his pro career in woods has been very open about his end goal that is to overtake jack nicklauss record of major wins by far the most significant number to woods is he currently has major championships a number he has been stuck on since when he won the us open woods is still just ahead of nicklauss major winpace nicklaus won his th major at age woods is his th birthday is in december he was in contention in three of the four majors last year yet faded badly on the pressurepacked weekends this years masters tournament which starts on april will be his first real test though it is impossible to know for sure his personal life seems a bit more settled he is dating the skier lindsey vonn on the course he has putted well this year his ironplay has been solid he has been long and fairly straight off the tee but will all of that hold up under the pressure of a major a pressure that is both inherent in any major and put upon by himself he hasnt won at augusta since his next major winif there is onewill be his

priority animal welfare facts the iditarod trail committee itc takes great pride in its role of providing excellence in dog care not only during the race but through an extensive program of prerace

required to be dewormed within days of the race start using medication provided through the itc before entering the iditarod a musher must complete approved qualifying races generally it takes a minimum of two years to prepare for the experience as it simply is not possible for someone to participate in the iditarod without having made a substantial investment of time and effort in coming to understand the intricacies of how to properly manage and care for their dogs in other words mushers possess real life experience in providing the proper care nutrition hydration rest etc for their teams in addition to the high standard of care provided by the mushers themselves more than forty licensed veterinarians volunteer their time on the trail to perform routine evaluations and administer any necessary treatments during the race well over routine checkpoint veterinary examinations take place dog team diaries also referred to as vet books are carried by each musher mushers present them

center supportcontact sponsorships site map privacy policyhome race news center supportcontact sponsorships site map privacy policydropped dog care by stuart nelson jr dvm i have often been asked about dogs that are dropped from the race longdistance sled dog races such as the iditarod require mushers to finish with only those dogs who started the race although none may be added to the team after the start they can be dropped at any checkpoint and for any reason a maximum of sixteen dogs may start in an iditarod team and at least five are required to be in harness to officially finish reasons for dropping dogs are numerous attitude problems fatigue illness immaturity injury being in heat lack of speed and musher strategy are the more common ones the race typically consists of over canine participants along an mile trail during a two week period obviously we must be prepared to address almost any possible medical condition just as with any other large population over time an elaborate system has been established to care for and transport dropped dogs so that they can safely return to their home kennels preparations begin long before the race start local contact forms are completed for each team persons serving as local contacts for a musher must be located within one hour of anchorage these individuals are responsible for picking up dropped dogs for a given musher after the animals arrive back from the trail dog care agreement forms are also completed prior to the race and specify which veterinary clinic a particular mushers dogs should be taken to in the event of the need for medical treatment during the race mushers must complete a dropped dog form before releasing a canine from competition an explanation of the reasons for dropping is requested along with the mushers name and dog identification typically if an illness or injury is present a veterinarian has already examined the animal in the event that this has not taken place an examination is performed as soon as possible any previous relevant medications administered and current treatments are also recorded on the form in addition to the names of the veterinarians completing the exam also indicated on the dropped dog form is the condition status although rare dogs with potentially lifethreatening conditions are designated red this status receives the highest level of priority and every effort is made to stabilize the animal and immediately arrange for an air evacuation to a wellequipped medical facility dogs undergoing treatment for anything of a lesser nature are designated as blue and depart on the next routine flight all remaining dogs are officially considered to be white and will be flown out in an orderly fashion the dropped dog forms are completed in quadruplicate the bottom copy goes to the checker for documentation of dropped dog numbers the top two copies leave a checkpoint with the appropriate dog with one going to dropped dog personnel in anchorage and the other traveling home with the animal the third copy remains with the last veterinarian to leave the checkpoint all dropped dogs from the east side of the alaska range are flown back to anchorage via small airplanes provided by the iditarod air force mcgrath serves as a hub for checkpoints in the interior typically the air force flies dogs from smaller interior checkpoints to mcgrath where commercial carriers northern air cargo and penair then transport them back to anchorage unalakleet serves as a coastal hub with the same protocol dropped dogs from the last two to three coastal checkpoints will move to nome where they are usually reunited with their teams and flown back with them on alaska airlines as hub locations mcgrath unalakleet and nome have appropriately larger numbers of dropped dog personnel at each of these veterinarians are present to evaluate and reevaluate dropped dogs moving through the system the final examination by iditarod veterinarians occurs when each animal returns to anchorage prior to being released in conclusion it is critical that mushers sponsors veterinarians and lay personnel work as a team for the best possible animal care

gannett co incdogs used in the iditarod six dogs died in the iditarod it is believed that two of the dogs froze to death musher lou packer admitted that he could feel ice form under the skin of one of the two dogs before he died three other dogs dropped dead on the trail and the cause of their deaths is inconclusive the sixth dog died of unknown causes during a flight out of the area after her team was scratched from the race the iditarod is a cruel event that causes dogs to suffer and die dogs in the iditarod pull heavy sleds through some of the worst weather conditions on the planet including to mph winds whiteouts and temperatures as low as f their feet are torn apart by ice and distance many dogs pull muscles incur stress fractures or become sick with diarrhea dehydration intestinal viruses or bleeding stomach ulcers in january the journal of veterinary internal medicine published an assessment showing that percent of the sled dogs studied exhibited an increased frequency of gastric erosions or ulcers after completing the iditarod none of the dogs studied had exhibited these symptoms before the race another study published in the american journal of respiratory and critical care medicine in found that percent of the dogs run in the iditarod had abnormal accumulations of mucus or cellular debris in their lower airways according to the report this accumulation was classified as moderate to severe in nearly half of the dogs racing to the death at least dogs have suffered and died on the iditarod trail since records of the race started being kept three dogs perished in the race one who died after inhaling his own vomit another who was killed after being hit by a snowmachine another dog was seriously injured in the same incident and a third who died of unknown causes at least five mushers quit the race because their dogs were ill and suffering in addition two dogs were abandoned by their musher when they left the team and she was unable to locate them greed prevails iditarod organizers downplay the dogs suffering and work to hide the abuses from the public even when mushers are caught beating dogs as musher ramy brooks was in he barely received a slap on the wrist even though one of his dogs later died rather than banning him for life the iditarod committee will allow brooks to race again today s event lacks the purpose of the original iditarod which was a race along a mail route to deliver an emergency supply of diphtheria serum to nome now the participantsalmost none of whom are indigenous alaskansare motivated solely by the cash prize and they will do almost anything to get it in addition to being subjected to the obvious cruelty of the race itself dogs used in the iditarod also pay a terrible price behind the scenes not every puppy born is a fast runner and those who do not make the grade are usually killedsometimes by bludgeoningfor not possessing monumental stamina and speed mushers freely admit that dogs who do not measure up are killed and one musher equates it to weeding a garden almost invariably those dogs who survive the cull spend their lives in cramped substandard kennels that are rarelyor neverinspected by any regulatory agency many kennel operators keep dogs tethered on short ropes or chains want to help spread the word share this facebook post post by peta people for the ethical

ve said everything here that i ve been saying only with far greater eloquence brava linda says july at pm excellent points of course they wanted to draw viewers using the recognizable names of sherlock holmes and dr watson i will tune in and try to suppress my instinct to compare the characters with what i expect from the books and the outstanding bbc sherlock if it s good on its own merits i will watch but it won t make me love bbc sherlock any less as benedict says there is room linda says july at pm i should add that i hope it is good there is always room for quality red raven says july at pm oh how spot on this comment is i love you whoever you are charley says july at am i must admit it does seem very likely that they are cashing in on the movie s and series success and that is why they have used the names sherlock on watson to publicise more than anything this show wouldn t of got half as much spotlight if it didn t have their names i get the feeling that this show would of gone down better if the makers and actors would just stop pretending they have based this off the books because going by the trailer all they have in fact done is take the name holmes amp watson johnny says he has based the character of the books but the trailer made me think he picked up the wrong book by accident this is what is annoying me most really about the show the fact the cast and crew seem to be in denial of this the trailer shows us that all they have done is took the names of the characters for publicity with no intention of actually making it anything like sherlock holmes yet they continue to talk a load of well rubbish really granted i know the trailer is only minutes but considering trailers are supposed to draw us in i think it is fair to base our arguments on it i m still willing to give it a watch because we could be wrong but i doubt it bonnie says july at am that is the main point that is maybe at the heart of the reaction to elementary its not that a tv show is being made and everyone there is to do their job etc but all the talk about it being different than sherlock as if out of nowhere they decided to do a sherlock holmes tv show and this is how they invisioned it from the beginning is not how it was they did want to remake the show that we know as sherlock and were told no linda says july at am i expect they will also keep his ability to deduce all sorts of things from his observations and perhaps his experiments claire says august at am well said the same can almost be said of robert d jr s interpretation i enjoyed jude law as watson the settings were lovely but the movos were trying to be a period action too hard when ieliminated the fact that it was the sherlock holmes i was meant to be seeing i could enjoy the movies much better as the scruffy holmes they chose to portray i simply could not reconcile with the original researchgrrrl says august at am claire i do wish the set up would allow me to reply to you rather than my own comment i think the reason i cut the rdj version a bit more slack was because a it was developed without even knowing that moffatt and gatiss had decided to go for a modern version of the stories and instead because mainstream studios are slowly and belatedly starting to notice that neovictoriana and steampunk visuals have a lot of appeal and b making sherlock brawny and living in his body as much as he does his mind was the only crucial change jude law s watson is still a former soldier still a respected medical doctor and there as sherlock s flatmate and friend rather than having his companionship paid for by sherlock s father oh and he s also still a chap the movies are set in essentially the original time period and setting albeit skewing toward that neovictorianasteampunk feel so a sweaty scruffy holmes at least still has the right context including his interactions with and reactions from watson in which to operate and i m only expected to suspend that one significant element of disbelief i can do that without any problem and enjoy it about as much as i would any other earnest piece of silly fanfic for me successful pastiche works sort of along the lines of scientific research change one independent variable the time period sherlock s investment in the physical world and you can explore how everything else is affected as a result change all the variables cbs s elementary has changed while still claiming to be based in acd canon and you have a lot of your potential audience going are you kidding me if they re being polite that day all i can do is point again to fox s house house and wilson were based holmes and watson and many of their qualities mapped directly on to the originals but the creators never tried to convince us we were watching the adventures of holmes and watson they made sure to pay tribute to their series inspiration over the years but otherwise went about creating their own fullyrealised universe anyway all that to say i found the recent movie adaptations easy to watch in a way i expect i ll have trouble doing with elementary i haven t ruled out the possibility of enjoying it but the are you kidding me is strong with this one also i had the pleasure of watching both versions of frankenstein featuring jlm and ben i enjoyed their respective monsters fairly equally but ben s victor blew jlm s out of the water ben did what even ken branagh tried but couldn t quite do he made victor a sympathetic character i ve never come across another performer who managed that and that ability to make even victor a sympathetic character very much shows in ben s sociopathic sherlock we can see why john and lestrade like him jlm did not demonstrate anything near so interesting or compelling as victor that s also shaping my apprehension about his attempt at sherlock jack says july at pm yes i ve never seen it but this will suck cause i m an idiot and i make snap judgements before i actually have evidence yeah internet reply larry david says july at pm seems like you re mad that everyone thinks this will suck because it will suck reply sggrant says july at pm suck or not it will still pull better ratings on cbs than sherlock on pbs temis says july at pm hee hee well the real story here is the cbs audience doesn t know or care what s on the bbc cbs is taking public domain character and shaping it to the tastes of their audience which they do supremely well as evidenced by their continuing success in an industry that is rapidly going down the tubes all the other networks are struggling in the ratings but cbs is a ratings generating machine their sherlock will be a big hit and the fans here will cry bitterly about it but it won t make the slightest difference to cbs i won t be watching the show but i m not cbss audience so why would i they don t make shows for me or for the people in this thread and they do very well with that approach reply jim from it says august at am eloquently put anderson mycroft start a war before you got home did he all we where doing was having a friendly little discussion then you come along acting like someone killed your dinosaur well i believe congratulations are in order as you single handily lowered the iq of the entire comment section so why don t you go away and stop inflicting your opinions on the world sh ps your wife is having an affair best call sally round laterz reply iloveyourcomment says august at am wanted to say that i love your comment it brought a huge smile to my fae seeing all the references to bbc s sherlock now i am gonna go watch reichenbach and have all these feelings liddad says july at pm i think the bbc s will stay the best as they have an hour and a half for each episode and much more time spent on the production and writing of each individual episode so that the small number of episodes that there are is still as if not more satisfying because it s like we got featurelength films reply jules says july at pm agree steven moffatt s sherlock is the best guy ricthie s sherlock hmm not bad cbs s sherlock will suck cbs and us television must stop copy people s idea and start to be creative honestly i have a big sympathy to miller he is a good actor i really like him as much as i like bc but playing in something is not really original and watson is female i don t think so isn t sherlock holmes is about masculinity and bromance reply tehimas says october at am i am totally agree with you reply sherlock fan says october at am this is what benedict said i hate to blow our own trumpet but we did actually start it we did the pilot waaay before they wanted to do the film and in fact its rumored that the weinsteins and other people that had to do with warner had already heard about the property the idea that we were doing a modern adaptation of it and thought ah we havent had sherlock holmes in a long time as a movie franchise and it popped up you know we were a bit sour about it at the beginning we were kind of oh really really were just getting off the ground with this idea and then we saw it and went aw its great we can both exist at the same time and i just think that elementary is just a rip off sherlock bbc i mean come on even the title card is a copy i bet they just thought oh yeah hav u seen that british show which is modern day sherlock holmes lets do a copy but in america artem says july at pm indeed reply templar says july at pm imo miller reads as more of a serial killer than ace detective i ll give it a try but i m not optimistic bc is a class act and good for him taking the high road reply maja says july at pm joan watson and else i think honestly he does feel a bit weird about it especially because a friend of his plays holmes but overall i agree that i don t see why they shouldn t try and do their version reply goku says july at pm am i the only one who thinks there is also sexual tension between sherlock and watson gt reply minkoz says july at pm bless you for this comment reply lauramc says july at pm you are most definitely not alone reply keren says july at pm haha no i think that they are just a good bromance reply billyandme says july at pm not alone at all reply shannon says july at pm nope i was going to post the same thing reply nochance says july at pm no you re not alone but we know that it s always going to be subtext and will never turn into will theywon t theywhen will they with elementary i m almost certain that cbs will draw in the shippers by keeping up the ust for as long as possible reply a rosenfeld says july at pm i don t think there is any sexual tension between sampw in bbc s sherlock quite the contrary sherlock is obviously uncomfortable with personal intimacy and watson has a liking for the ladies i frankly am tired of people being incapable of accepting two men s love and devotion for each other as just that sex does not always have to enter the picture between two individuals frodo and samwise is another good example i am a straight woman with many male and female friends whom i love and care very deeply for but i have no interest in having sex with them reply linda says july at pm thank you it s sad our culture has been so sexualized that a lot of people are incapable of seeing any affection between two people without thinking it means they want to sleep together reply mary says july at pm yes yes yes i couldn t have said it better reply kathy says july at pm thank you for expressing my feelings exactly i too am a little weary of slashing reply brandy says july at pm see this is how i see housewilson no ust at all it was great just as it was one of the great bromances john and sherlock not so much i ve never been a fan of any slash pairing anywhere but this one practically jumps off the screen at me reply emily says july at pm it s partly a fantasy thing i personally being a slash shipper can attest to the fact that i do realize that the sherlock x john romance shall most likely never be but i still do it and bask in all of it s adorableness it just makes me warm and fuzzy thinking about it i wish it would happen but it probably won t although there are subtle hints in the show that could give one the impression of there being a bit more than a bromance lol xd and we aren t idiots for christ s sake we don t think that if you are close to someone in any way shape or form that it means you want to fck them to put it bluntly i at least am not that ignorant considering i also have friends whom i don t want to fck coughs sorry if i sounded a bit angryvicious there just is a bit annoying when someone takes you for an idiot reply renee says july at pm thank you reply moni says august at pm i totally agree sherlock does not want to wasteclutter his energy on romance he has his senses focused on the work which without his mind would rot as he so emphatically stated reply gilda says july at pm if the showrunners went down that road i would die from happiness you re not the only one reply holland says july at pm i don t remember who said this but the fact that they both need each other but not necessarily want each other is part of appeal to both of them who said anything about soul mates needing to be romantically involved reply bobbi says july at am if the actual characters of holmes and watson were written in the books as gay then fine but holmes doesn t have time for anything like that one way or the other and watson is straight sherlock and john in the tv do need each other both of their lives were changed when they met each other the show does use that as what some from the outside might be thinking but its not so and i have yet to see john watson who is always trying to find a date give any impression he would be interested in sherlock other than a friend they have great chemistry these are wonderful actors who just happen to work together perfectly and chemistry is not the same as wanting to have a sexual relationship but anyone has a right to think what they do about them it is still a fantasy reply mikael says july at am there definitely is in the robert downey jr amp jude law sherlock amp watson reply kara says july at pm i love this guy so classy can t wait for season three of sherlock still on the fence about elementary reply sk says july at pm agreed reply jack says july at pm how can you be on the fence about something you haven t even seen odd reply larry david says july at pm seems like youre mad that everyone thinks this will suck because it will suck reply olivia says july at pm well i dunno maybe just maybe she could be on the fence as to if she even wants to watch it oh i dunno it can t possibly be that reply jennifer says july at pm it worked on hawaii with kono although as watson i don t know how she s going to keep her hands off jonny lee miller i know i couldn t reply sovietkitsch says july at pm i m a bbc sherlock fan but i loathe the overtly proud and somewhat obnoxious attitude of some bbc sherlock fans about elementary it s ridiculous so what if cbs is hopping on the sherlock holmes bandwagon countless adaptations have been done some fans think bbc had the only rights to do a modern retelling the show hasn t even premiered yet and it has been met with comments from lamenting on lucy liu s casting to johnny s scarf copying from benedict s sherlock and the reviews i ve heard of elementary s pilot episode screening in comic con were great so i think i ll give it a shot reply brooke says july at pm agreed i have read so many different sherlock holmes adaptations over the years and they re all fun and entertaining whenever i hear about a new one i look forward to getting it from the library if there can be dozens of sherlock holmes books written by different authors over the years there can definitely be two shows with different spins on it as long as it s well written and enjoyable i m all for it reply temis says july at pm yeah i ve been seeing pro cbs backlash because of the obnoxious and prejudiced fans who rant about a show that s yet to even air however it doesn t matter what any of us say or think about this because the cbs audience is not the same group of people who comment on websites like this cbs knows their audience and they re making a show for their audience not for any of us reply charley says july at am i think the problem that most are having it not the fact they are making the show because they are clearly free to do so it is the fact that they only seem to have taken the names sherlock and watson for publicity the trailer and press interviews show us that the characters barely resemble those in the books yet the cast and crew are still denying this fact saying they have gone back to the books although just to add in this case i think it is fairly obvious they are just trying to pull in profit from the movie and bbc series this being said i still believe that elementry has the potential to be a good show just that it is also going to be a terrible interpretation of the books at the same time ie it will barely resemble them this is what is seems to be making most people mad me included but this being said as someone pointed out above it will still probably do well i will certainly give it a go just a general question though am i the only one who thinks johnny s acting in the trailer is terrible like he is a bit bored and didn t but any effort in but not in a good sherlock way but rather in a terrible acting way which is strange because he was fantastic in frankenstein reply mandy says july at pm tbh i think he s good in general in the trailer but not in the way as sherlock holmes and no he is not great in frankenstein miller is not as solid on stage comparing with genuinely seasoned stage actors he s much better on tv and in films reply bobbi says july at pm it seems to me with just watching the previews that jonny is playing sherlock as a hyper person there s a moment where he almost seems wildeyed maybe it s because he is off the drugs there is barely mention of the cocaine in the books from what i ve heard from people and coping with that but maybe that might just be in the pilot and he kind of calms down usa today had an article on the cbs shows and the producer said our sherlock has emerged with a tiny kernel of selfdoubt where one never existedi don t see him as a sociopath i see him as someone who s driven to do the right thing ok reply hamza says december at pm oh come on darling tell me youre someone who wouldnt fight for a phenomenal cause reply lisa says july at pm i haven t seen cumberbatch s sherlock and every time he opens his mouth i am less inclined to ever watch it maybe it s something that is lost in translation but he always seems to be looking down his nose at everyone else i am looking forward to seeing elementary this fall however reply suds says july at pm ridiculous accusation benedict has never said a bad word about anyone unjustingly reply me says july at pm your loss reply tmort says july at pm you re really missing out if you re a holmes fan you are doing a disservice to yourself if you don t try the fantastic bbc version and at least give it a shot not sure why you think cumberbatch is looking down his nose at everyone else from various reports from people who work with him actors producers directors etc he is a truly kind and generous actor being that he is a friend of jlm and they worked together very closely for a national theatre production in i believe he is sincere about the well wishes for the cbs version even though i m a huge fan of the bbc version and of cumberbatch i m going to give this version a try it s not like i ll be out anything but some time if i dislike it reply me says july at pm did you miss the part where he said he wishes them good luck and thinks the show is going to be good how is that looking down his nose at everyone else reply giraffe says july at pm but he always seems to be looking down his nose at everyone else really since when reply saint alicia says july at pm agreed everything out of his mouth is wrapped in condescension god forbid tv is deprived of another male friendship there s a dearth of those these days and don t you know a malefemale friendship could never stack up to the bedrock of a bromance oh but excuse me there s absolutely nothing romantic between the bbc s holmes and watson moffat shouting no homo in every interview should ve put that to rest though why is bandicoot cumbersnatch even weighing in on this in the first place am i missing the relevance of an actor from a different show and remake in it s own right providing his inputblessing he must be the reincarnation of conan doyle otherwise who cares what he thinks and elementary won t steal bbc viewers because it s automatically positioned to have a separate bigger audience just by virtue of being an american production on cbs bc should stick to complaining about downton abbey s large crossover appeal compared to sherlock s cult status he needn t move on to elementary reply linda says july at pm he weighs in on it because everyone asks him about it benedict has an educated brit accent and a natural british reserve that is not condescension i agree that us fans should give elementary a chance and it s unfortunate they are bashing it without seeing it but that is not benedict s fault or anything he has encouraged you are doing exactly the same thing in reverse reply saint alicia says july at pm benedict has an educated brit accent the hell does that have to do with anything especially a print interview i swear reply linda says july at pm since you said everything out of his mouth i assumed you had readseen other interviews i apologize for my assumption if that s not the case btw he didn t complain about downton s appeal he and a friend from downton were teasing each other and his comments were taken out of context and misrepresented the media loves to overdramatize and create feuds where they don t exist so they can sell paperstv ads it is hard to determine attitude condescension etc from written not to mention edited versions of interviews so give the guy a break plus you need to take into account the differences between american and british ways of expression hamza says december at pm well ofcourse the british accent is intimidating numbnuts conductoroflight says july at pm i must politely insist that your opinion of benedict is severely misinformed there is a media trap that surrounds benedict misuse of quotes leaving out explanations or context specifically for the controversy it could stir such as the downtown abbey complaints which was actual a tease between friend i think you ll find if you look more into his full interviews you ll see his a severely humble very generous man reply erika says july at pm because elementary has been taking every chance to cause buzz by utilizing the popularity of the bbc s sherlock including hiring miller who was cumberbatch s costar on the stage production frankenstein in which they shared two main roles and swapped every night in and the press has been asking cumberbatch the question since cbs announced its plan i even suspect this socall new interview with cumberbatch was done when he s in nyc to promote sherlock s in this may in other words not a new interview at all i m not against elementary but i don t like what cbs has done to generate buzz for it if i didn t already know i d thought that it s cumberbatch to star as sherlock holmes in elementary if you don t like to see so many elementary news getting cumberbatch included go ask cbs to stop using him to publicize elementary thank you very much reply templar says july at pm watch cumberbatch as hugh laurie s son in fortysomething nothing arrogant about him he s the real deal and a fine example of a brit actor reply tmort says july at pm yes great show great acting all around by bc really stands out reply elatus says july at am see the show and than comment my view to the both side of discussion if you don t want to see bbc sherlock lisa then don t but the reason is somehow ridiculous benedict is in very awkward position here between his good breed friendship with jlm and producers of his show saying that he sound proud is the last thing i would say about it reply jw says july at pm bets on how fast are they going to try to get joan to holmes bed only reason to change it reply ley leyla says july at pm i dont think theyll steal our audience he s so right because bbc sherlock s is absolutely unique and its fans are adamantly loyal and truly addicted to this really good show reply keren says july at pm and the bbc only do episodes a year so they can easily share the audience reply keren says july at pm only does reply bow says july at pm i have to laugh at the cbs production team posting on here they wont be laughing when the ratings slip reply nick says july at pm why would it it s cbs s most buzzedabout pilot and most critics who saw it at comiccon liked it reply moni says august at pm critics don t make a show s ratings we do reply nick says august at pm that s what i meant by cbs s most buzzedabout pilot reply j says july at pm maybe we want to see a different dynamic and to see something new isn t something you should be frightened of reply sk says july at pm cumberbatch is very gracious class act while i feel that cbs should be ashamed of the way it brought elementary to the screen cumberbatch is right in that the bbc s sherlock has nothing to fear from elementary i also believe that the sexual tension of elementary will greatly alter the dynamics of the narrative which forecloses some and opens up other directions for narrative exploration for better or worse shall be seen and i really do not like that they ve basically turned dr watson into holmes na watchdog sorry but that s just lame reply babygirl says july at pm benedict is far from being a snob or looking down his nose you apparently do not know anything about him of course he has said something he does dislike immensley is mediocrity which is apparent because it s something he doesn t get involved with as said if you know what the people who work with him say then you would not be saying what you did he s a generous person and so intelligent and they just can t praise him enough he was brought up speaking correct english and surrounded by acting parents and people who spoke well and tho they were not rich actors he went to good schools with help from his grandmother knowlege is important to him and he cares very much for the work he does anyone on here who hasn t seen sherlock there are ways to find it to check it out actually i just see sherlock and john as friends moffat and gatiss and ben also see them as one of the great friendships and that s all of all time people can see what they want but have never seen anything but that reply hcdp says july at pm when i first heard about elementary i thought it was going to just be a copy cat version of the bbc s sherlock now however having heard more of the basic premise besides it being a modern update i m curious about the direction they want to take this though i have to agree i am a little apprehensive about a female watson there are so many ways it can be done right and be absolutely fantastic but it can go wrong much more easily if the whole cast and crew are able to keep that solid friendship between the two especially with waston being a woman and transform it into something different because a friendship between men and women is different added sexual tension or not i think the show can work i just don t want to see their relationship being all about the will they won t they reply mare says july at pm i tried the bbc s sherlock for two seasons and i honestly don t understand the fuss i can t stand their sherlock he is irredeemably obnoxious the only one i like is watson so i m really looking forward to a version of holmes that doesn t make me hate the lead and i m honestly annoyed by all the superior bbc sherlock fans looking down on this show they haven t even seen yet guess what not everyone likes your precious show and it doesn t mean we have no taste so how about you all stop bashing this show and nonsherlock fans and stop it with your condescension this version may or may not be great but yours isn t the precious perfection you all think it is either reply red raven says july at pm every fandoms have fans like that it s just hard for them to swallow another sherlock holmes story after being fed with guy ritchie s and bbc s version it s okay if don t like the show even jeremy brett s watson david burke doesn t think highly of bbc sherlock because he thinks theirs is betterwhich i slightly agree on but i really think bbc sherlock done well enough the original sherlock holmes isn t likable at all even some of his friends loathe his attitude the only thing fans love in him is his charisma intellect and the way he solves things so if you re trying to find a not obnoxious sherlock holmes then i think you re wasting your time plus judging from the trailer cbs s sherlock holmes is not likable either reply paul says december at am my favorite comment holmes has become a bit domesticated over the many decades of adaptation the original version was polite but not likeable now that time has passed and i ve seen several episodes of elementary it seems to me that doyle s creation is like shakespeare there s room enough for many versions miller is doing a great job and the writers have gone out of their way to squelch any romance i m surprised i like lucy liu in the role i think it only works because she s not the faithful sidekick but has her own issues i d say benedict was spot on when he suggested they would have to walk a tightrope because that is what they are managing to do so far reply barbie furtado says july at pm you know i don t like bbc s version as much either and it s because i can t stand him he s absolutely superior he treats people badly and his intelligence isn t all that impressive and i ve never grown attached to watson also it s a double episode in the british pace which makes it suuuupppppeeer sloooowww and it makes it very tiring to watch i still haven t watched last season s finale because i don t have the patience for it and i m not american i m brazilian i ve read every single sherlock holmes book by the age of i wanted to love it like most everyone does i really do love guy ritichie s version but i never got into the show i know they re going to change everything in elementary but i m not judging just yet i was a huge fan of the rizzoli amp isles books and i possibly love the show more than the books now and they changed everything but their names just about reply brandy says july at pm you ve read the books and you think bbc s sherlock is too unlikeable i get uncomfortable during the books because holmes treats watson so badly he s a total asshole in canon at least he bbc version is an asshole who s interesting to watch reply barbie furtado says july at pm i just don t agree with you i think he s an arrogant snot in the show in the books his brilliancy shows through in the show he seems like a conceited kid reply conductoroflight says july at pm well consider the age of the characters you re discussing he seems like a conceited kid because he is one in a way in most of the books john and sherlock have been together for some time and they re both over sherlock is in his early s in this version and john is about and the series starts when they ve only just meet one another their chemistry is automatic but sherlock hasn t had a companion for most if not all of his adult life he s still learning how to interact with people in a way that isn t only a means to an end part of the subtle wonder of this show is watching how john s presence as sherlock s one and only friend changes the detective bonnie says july at pm as the comment said the show starts out with them meeting for the first time in their s that s one of the things moffat wanted to do to show them at the beginning and then show what happens when watson comes into the picture rem lestrad close saying sherlock was a great man and someday he might be a good one even at the end of the first show when watson counters with his own because you re an idiot and sherlock smiles there s a scene in the first season where his friend from college says we all hated him you didn t notice the look on his face the way he looked down it s just a split second but that comment hurt him benedict is a master of having a look convey what is not said out loud the humor in it is wonderful the performances are great and for the people who do love the show think we see more to sherlock than just the surfacewe know he is a good man too barbie furtado says july at pm i m sorry but i disagree i don t think the show is funny i think she show s slow and unappealing i do get what they tried to do but i don t think in any way they achieved the mastery or brilliancy of the books i like the guy ritchie version much much more i truly really hate cumberbatch s sherlock i think robert downey jr s a million times better and i d never been a fan of his before i used to adore the books growing up i wanted to be a detective just like sherlock holmes i am extremely bummed at the british version linda says july at pm most of the episodes start out slow and build in pace imo i tend to watch most tv while doing something else i started watching sherlock that way and didn t get into it at first then i realized it was one of those shows that you have to pay close attention to when i did that i absolutely fell in love with the show i have watched all the episodes at least two or three times and there is so much more to see each time i almost never watch a tv show or movie more than once but sherlock keeps delivering reply bb says july at am i think not catching the humor means thinking it s suppose to be funny like a comedy it has wit which is diffierent than just being funny its in the way they interact with each other i like rdj but to me he is rdj being rdj with a british accent reply indi says july at pm love the bbc version it s beyond my favorite i mean i dare you to watch it and not think its brilliant however i also love guy ritichie s movie version with rdj ad jude law do you i think they should have turned john into a girl no but i ll certainly not judge till i ve seen it i just wish the us didn t try to marginalize and remake every popular brit show reply michael sacal says july at pm crossover sherlocks of two worlds reply michael sacal says july at pm two sherlocks are better than one come on they could say that they are related through their fathers and that one stole the other s name for their son because they thought it was cool or something reply sbental says august at am that could be epic reply amanda says july at pm whatever people are mad about watson being a girl because then they can t pretend that holmes and watson are gay together during elementary by this point i m sick of steven moffat and i hope lucy liu plays everyone s favorite white male characters lord knows there are plenty of them reply molly says july at am if lucy liu could act that might be some kind of a threat but as i ve seen more animated blocks of wood than ms liu it s more of a joke reply linda says july at am i thought she was excellent in her guest arc on southland reply gerard says july at pm but when they make a teen sherlock holmes that hunts vampires and is going to sing all the time that s when i stop watchingha ha lets just wait and see reply red raven says july at pm i think someone s going to make sherlock holmes vs frankenstein try searching that reply temis says july at pm coming this fall on the cw reply gandalftheblack says july at am you have no idea how awesomely brilliant that idea is i hope someone will make it happen reply bobbiel says july at pm of course not everyone is going to like sherlock but the people who do love it love it to make up for the ones that don t sherlock holmes has always been a pain but in a way that s the fun of himthere s a lot of dry humor in that tho just thought if i didn t like the character the first time i watched itwhy watch whole seasons of someone you don t like tho you did like watson so did you turn down the tv when sherlock was on even tho you don t like him you are seeing one of the greatest actors you are ever going to see when they were doing the voice over for study in pink moffat or gatiss were talking and watching a scene being shot and they thought where is benedict they just saw sherlockwhere did sweet affable benedict go we just love the show and we re not saying jonny isn t good or that it won t be written well etc we have seen the previews to see how at least it will play out to some extent possibly if sherlock was more well known in america it doesn t get much publicity and even tho it just got emmy nominations being on pbs is not like being on the main networks and the fact cbs went to the bbc to redo sherlock and they said no it s not the downy version they went after sometimes when america redoes a show from britain the show has already gone off the air so maybe that s some of the feeling so for those who don t like sherlock then hope you do really enjoy elementary simple as that and am sure both can be liked moffat amp gatiss just love pretty much anything that has sherlock attached to it so when they got to do their tv show it was a labor of love they talked about doing it years before they actually got around to it and it was a dream for them to do and were not sure how it was going to go but it turned out ok for them reply red raven says july at pm plus they deemed every plausible sherlock holmes before them canon guy ritchie s not included as it came the same time as them reply liddad says july at pm as a scotsman i m asking you to please spell downey with the e as without the e in scotland it s an extremely offensive term for a person with downs syndrome reply michelle says july at pm there s no reason you can t be a fan of both shows elementary can take the edge off the wait for more bbc sherlock and this is hardly benedict breaking his silence he s been asked several times about elementary and has said good things every time and he s right the dynamic will be different but different does not equal bad reply lickydisco says july at pm the only thing that would have made this brief article supurb dear michael is if you had audio to it so we bc fans could have gone all swoony over his lovely voice sigh he s so dreamy reply ewa says july at pm well we ll see in about two seasons if it stays on that long obviously even if they avoid the sexual tension during the first season they will start singing a different tune once they start running out of better ideas and by the third season we ll have the will theywon t they in full swing reply julie says july at pm one problem is falling into the usual cbs procedural category after a while as they say they won t be taking from the actual stories will be interesting to see where they go reply jack says july at pm bbc sherlock fanatics are hilarious it s not even that they don t want to share the character as if you know your precious moffat made him up out of thin air pffft but i think it s more the case of them wanting to be special oooh look at me i love this show from overseas and you haven t even heard of it oooh look how special and cool i am lmao reply larry david says july at pm seems like youre mad that everyone thinks this will suck because it will suck reply liddad says july at pm actually i m from the uk and everyone here loves it the same way as the us fans and it s not a small show over here around million people in the uk watched season live that s a sixth of the population this show isn t just good it s great that s why people are obsessed with it elementary may not be bad but due to the extremely high standard set by moffat and gatiss interpretations it s going to be almost impossible to beat reply jane says july at pm three years ago i started to get bored of american looooonnnggg series too much episodes too much seasons too much changing characters from evil to good to indetermined it sucks so i was looking for something different and found wire in the blood being human misfits the tudors and so on great series few episodes per season and straight to the point and a spanish friend told me about the bbc s sherlock and nearly forced me to watch it he told me it was a must to me i believed him and i thank god he told me of this serie my first impression was wth is this but did not leave i watched the long first episode and love it i love this sherlock because he made me feel exactly the same i felt when i read the books this undetermined sense of love and hate admiration and anger towards sherlock holmes benedict cumberbatch and martin freeman did a great job with such iconic characters i could give elementary a chance but i know it will be a long season of episodes and that repeles me and maybe if the show make it and gets another season then maybe the writers will finally permit watson to fck sherlock holmes i believe that is a not so hidden desire for people who has read the books well a desire from modern people who wants to see sex in everything but you people can give elementary a chance i have no doubt it will be a good show but i stay with this one of the bbc reply julie says july at pm feel maybe there was a bit of sarcasm with the voice comment nothing wrong with thinking someone has a great voice benedict has done a lot of audio books and voice overs over the years because people have wanted that voice representing them want to joke about them too reply bobbie says july at pm didn t you read that moffat amp gatiss know all about the doyle stories and the movies that have been made they would be the last people who would say they were doing something new they even say sherlock in victorian times was current and also the rathbone movies were done in current times i love sherlock but never have i felt superior because i want others to see it don t think its different than anything someone thinks is good and they enjoy wanting others to see it or read it etc then its up to the other person to like it or not no big deal reply chuck finley aj says july at pm i dunno i like mysteries and the bbc sherlock is movies a year i don t mind cbs giving it a try and i have to reserve judgment until i actually see what they have come up with i tend to trust cbs more than the like of abc and nbc when it comes to dramas reply chuck finley aj says july at pm and outside of his love for glee lol i tend to trust when ausiello says a show is good reply linda says july at pm it s not even episodes a year it s closer to episodes every months the next series will start filming in january after that the intervals may get even longer since both benedict cumberbatch and martin freeman are in increasing demand with high profile movie roles coming out in the next year the hobbit star trek both have said they want to continue doing sherlock but it may be harder and harder to coordinate their schedules one of the things i like about british actors is they tend to mix media throughout their careers doing tv film theater and radio american actors tend to stay mostly in one category though this has been changing hopefully elementary will be good enough to tide us over reply at says july at pm i don t see the problem in enjoying both i don t know why people are getting so upset over it seriously it s just silly reply jellygirl says july at pm jolly good pilot i must have missed something because i caught the pilot at comiccon and i have to say i wasn t impressed and it has nothing to do with watson being female i was actually pretty bored during the preview and only perked up once the panelqampa started maybe it was due to con fatigue my friend was literally falling asleep or maybe i just needed closed captions i couldn t help comparing it to bbc s sherlock and elementary just isn t as funny or clever reply temis says july at pm cbs knows exactly what they re doing making watson female if this were the cw then two male leas might work but cbs s audience is too conservative that you know what i mean cbs is going to have another brig hit show on their hands reply alisonyahoocom says july at pm the british version of sherlock is peerless and part of that is the fact that they re not churning out episodes a year they re really almost minimovies that said i love johnny miller eli stone was underrated and i would love to see him in a show that was worthy of his abilities but the addition of lucy liu as watson substantially lowers my interest level she s just not very interestingtalented and i can t see what she s bringing to the table besides breasts also to because of the very nature of us series tv i have to wonder how consistent the quality level of the writing will be i ll probably watch the pilot but at this point it s not a mustsee reply linda says july at pm i like eli stone a lot which is one reason i m looking forward to elementary i do like lucy liu too i m a huge fan of sherlock and benedict cumberbatch i first noticed him in a tiny and somewhat unsympathetic role in the other boleyn girl his face showed so much that in a few lines i wanted to know more about his character and was disappointed that was the last he showed up in the movie i didn t know who he was but i though this is an actor to watch for in the future reply bobbie says july at pm it s the actors sherlock has benedict cumberbatch who is just awesome the brit version of prime suspect had helen mirren you just can t throw an adequate actor into a show and expect to match a show that has superb actors helen mirren really carried prime suspect elementary has lucy liu so that s very encouraging reply line says july at pm i m a fan of bbc s sherlock and i don t resent the fact that cbs wanted to make their own version of sherlock holmes these characters and stories are certainly not the sole property of bbc and i don t even doubt the fact that the first episodes maybe even the first season will be quite good even though i m a little bit more skeptical in the long term what i do resent however is the fact that elementary is almost a contigency plan after they had been refused the rights to simply redo sherlock it seems so opportunistic i think i just don t understand why it s such a trend in the us to do remakes of successful foreign shows or movies when they are easily accessible in the country otherwise and in this case already in english so they can t even blame the language barrier reply monoi says july at pm i was replying this post it s like the us movie of millenium same movie maybe with more rythm but some scenes were almost exactly the same what s the point too often americans try to appropriate european movies or ideas to pretend they can do better reply chuck finley aj says july at pm no they buy the rights and make the movie in english with actors people have actually heard of here some of us watch the originals with subtitles but hollywood can almost always throw a bigger budget and bigger name actors at good material why gripe about it the people who own the rights to those movies sold them and lined their pockets with the cash you don t have to watch the american version if you don t want to and i am sure we can start listing foreign movies that were remade here that are actually better reply line says july at am so bigger name actors are always better and foreign actors are just good enough for other countries and if hollywood can do their own version of a movie or show or whatever then it s just logical to do it because they have a bigger budget sorry but i still don t understand i think it s a shame you sometimes close yourselves to styles that are different from the hollywood one and of course the people who sell those rights make a lot of money but you can see that in this case sherlock s creators must have thought the same because they refused to sell their concept reply moni says august at pm i m in the us and am so glad moffat and gatiss refused to sell their spin of sherlock to hollywood we will give elementary a chance here different strokes for different folks but personally my heart is already smitten with the british version they were the first to latch on to the modern sherlock and they have done a fantastic job please please please keep up the good work jay says july at pm i love the bbc version of sherlock as well as the movies and after watching the first preview of elementary i wasn t too thrilled about it but after more footage came out i sorta changed my mind miller brings a slightly different voice to sherlock which is good because we d all get tired of the same adaptation of sherlock done the same over and over again and some sort of variety is needed and i think it s a bit different with joan watson and the america setting but still you can t really judge it right now until the first few episodes because you still don t know whether elementary will be a rare gem or just another show that lasts a year then disappears reply alice says july at pm i think that he is right about not feeling like elementary is going to steal sherlock s audience sherlock stays mostly true to the plots of the original stories changing things here and there to make it fit in with modern times elementary takes a completely different spin on things for example making watson a girl which may be interesting to watch however i think that people like me who have read the sherlock holmes stories numerous times and who are absolutely in love with them will perfer sherlock that and i have a huge crush on benedict cumberbatch reply sue says july at pm who doesn t have a huge crush on benedict lol reply lady heliotrope says july at pm sherlock stays mostly true to the plots of the original stories changing things here and there to make it fit in with modern times mmmmmmm i know what you mean but no that credential goes more to jeremy brett s tv series part of the fun of the sherlock bbc is the changes that manifested for example the tease about rache and the police assuming it was an unfinished word rachel in the books whereas the reverse delightfully takes place in sherlock bbc part of the charm of sherlock bbc is the close attention to canon do i anticipate elementary will do this absolutely not they re not sherlockians but i do hope the product is good on its own merit reply lady heliotrope says july at pm i mean to say moffat and gatiss paid close attention to canon and tweaked it it s fresh and fun because they explicitly did not give a playbyplay of the books in fact not a single episode has gone exactly like a single one of the stories they are all interwoven in a very modern easter egg fashion for us hardcore fans who know the stories already forward to back in its essence sherlock bbc is a fantastic mindblowingly good fan creation elementary writers i believe will not even open the books but i still remain optimistic for elementary reply monoi says july at pm because americans are egocentric idiots reply moni says august at pm not all of us reply sue says july at pm watson being paid to work with holmes is what bugs me about elementary it can t help but give their relationship a different dynamic and bbc sherlock is absolutely brilliant i find it hard to believe that elementary will even come close to being as good reply moni says august at pm that bugs me too it gives it a total materialistic leaning which is not what real friends are about reply lady heliotrope says july at pm hey just a question i m a fan of bbc and i think there s room for more holmes lore in all mediums sherlock holmes is a character of archetypal proportions i feel it would be just as ridiculous to say there s not enough room for another god in the greek pantheon to say that there isn t enough room for cbs elementary i will watch it when convenient no tv but here s my question why does watson along with the gender change have to be dishonorably discharged honor loyalty and virtue are things intrinsic to watson loyalty ultimately wins out every time but doing the honorable thing is a close second choice when loyalty does not enter the picture i hope the reason is exceptionally good for the character s loss of her credentials which seems a ridiculous reason for changing her professional orientation why not a hostile workplace that s certainly common enough particularly in the culture of medicine which is still patriarchal and can be at times antagonistic towards women and nonwhite medical professionals i hope that these elements of her identity are something to do with the loss of her credentials in a world where women especially nonwhite and immigrant women are struggling to mediate between work and family i d hate to see this potential for a great character study become a predictable endresult like lose your job because you acted out of compassion when a man would have had the common sense to get the job done without letting his feelings getting in the way no problem have babies with the next unstable person you work for that s all you re worth anyway i don t anticipate that elementary will actually comment on these social challenges but if the role of the woman doesn t become the same old thing that it always is james bond esque i will be intrigued a rather common theme in many medical political workplace dramas of the day i believe er set it in motion maybe with nurse jackie trying to challenge it recently reply linda says july at pm good point about watson s character we ll have to wait and see how they handle it reply janet says july at pm i ve seen the elementary pilot and i am a huge fan of the bbc sherlock they are quite different and as i am fond of saying any dose of sherlock holmes is better than no dose of sherlock holmes reply brandy says july at pm i m a huge bbc sherlock fan as well as a johnsherlock shipper i m pretty excited for elementary and i think that if they can do a badass female watson with nominimal ust it will be awesome people said starbuck could never be a woman too reply molly says july at am yes and they said they didn t do that to create a starbuckapollo romance too how long did that last again reply mybenediction says july at pm i nearly blew my top when i heard about this then i thought fair enough we don t own the books let them have a go then they announced the female watson oh dear logic what that is a line that should never be crossed i think johnny will make a good sherlock i saw him opposite benny in frankenstein and he was brilliant not quote as brilliant as benny but he s a class actor however taking the friendship between the two men is just the most awful mistake it is to put it frankly fan fiction not that im putting down fan fic i love it i write it but thats where it should remain why not just make watson a talking hedgehog the whole arch of sherlock holmes is the friendship of two men so sadly because of that i will not be watching it it is a step too far i find that a great shame as i would have liked to have seen johnny given the chance to explore that friendship and if you were lucky enough to see frankenstein you will know he could have played it beautifully sad but bless benedict tactful as always such a gent reply mrscumberbatch says july at pm everything that i know about elementary makes me cringe there are too many changes the characters are sherlock holmes and johnjoan watson in name only sherlock would never say sometimes i hate it when i m right reply moni says august at pm you are so right sherlock would never say that reply april says july at pm just because there hasn t been a female watson doesn t mean there there can t or should never be a female watson and if they do hookup who cares it s tv and most people do like when the characters get together on tv and why are people who watch bbc s sherlock act like no one is aloud to like elementary if they like sherlock i hardly think watching and liking elementary will take anything away from sherlock reply nick says july at pm this is the sanest comment i ve seen on this post all day i agree reply april says july at pm well thank you reply nick says july at pm you re welcome reply molly says july at pm this show is going to tank as lucy liu cannot act recast the part reply renee says july at pm what a nice man i love sherlock and i m looking forward to elementary reply vincentdante says july at pm i guess no one reading this article recalls the brilliant they might be giants where george c scott believes he is sherlock holmes and his female psychiatrist is dr watson as i recall there was even an nbc pilot years ago based on the movie reply stacey says july at pm sorry jolly good pilot unless they ve made drastic changes in the past month we ve seen two very different pilots it was bad as a cop drama and a sherlock holmes adaptation jonny lee miller was the only passable part so far the part they ve written for joan watson is ghastly and that s without comparing it to a holmeswatson relationship i

Query:Costa Concordia shipwreck
Page:ms costa concordia before the disaster aground with rigid lifeboats in foreground and inflatables hanging from the side of the ship after the grounding passengers and crew were taken ashore from the ship by lifeboats and helicopters or swam to the island leaving about people missing half of these were later found inside the ship most of them deceasedcitation needed evacuationedit in the first contact made at between italian port officials and the costa concordia after the impact on the reef an unidentified officer on board the cruise ship insisted that she was suffering only from an electrical blackout a passengers video recorded at showed panicked passengers in life jackets being told by a crew member that everything is under control and that they should return to their cabins no lifeboat passenger evacuation drill had taken place for the approximately passengers who had just embarked a ships cook said that captain schettino ordered dinner around around the same time a patrol boat of the guardia di finanza made a call to the costa concordia but no answer came captain schettino participated in three telephone calls with the cruise lines crisis management officer at schettino told the port of livornos harbour master that the ship had taken water through an opening in the port side and requested a tug boat port authorities were not alerted to the collision until about an hour after the impact and the order to evacuate the ship was not given until some passengers jumped into the water to swim to shore while others ready to evacuate the vessel were delayed by crew members up to minutes as they resisted immediately lowering the lifeboats some sources report that the ship did not list until and therefore if schettino had given the order to abandon ship the lifeboats could have been launched earlier allowing the passengers to reach safety in contrast one expert stated that a delay might be justified considering the hazards in launching lifeboats while a ship is still moving profile of stranded wreck with surrounding oil booms authorities banned all private boats from giglio porto and excluded them from a onenauticalmile m nonnavigation zone around the ship poor weather conditions could have caused a spill of oil from the ship a floating oil barrier was put in place as a precaution high winds on february lifted the protective barrier allowing into the surrounding waters an oily film that began spreading from the stern of the ship the protective boom was redesigned for the weather conditions on february civil protection director franco gabrielli told the italian senate that the waters were not crystalclear but are within the legal limits environment minister corrado clini told the parliament of italy that the amount of diesel fuel and lubricating oil on board costa concordia was about the cargo of a small oil tanker clini said any oil leakage would be highly toxic for plant and animal life in a first step to prevent pollution of the shore and assist in a refloat the ship her oil and fuel tanks were emptied isola del giglio lies within the pelagos sanctuary for mediterranean marine mammals one of the specially protected areas of mediterranean importance it is a popular scuba diving destination with tourism being its leading industry island residents were concerned that the wreck would be an eyesore that turned away tourists disabling the islands economy one resident explained environmental damage is what concerns us most if the oil pollutes the coast were ruined luigi alcaro head of maritime emergencies for italys institute for environmental protection and research ispra an agency of the ministry of the environment stated that in a worst case we could be talking years and dozens of millions of euros emsacontracted standby oil spill response vessel salina bay arrived at the site of costa concordia on january and will remain on station as a precautionary measure during the fuel removal operation ispras oceanographic ship astrea arrived in tuscany on january to conduct environmental investigations on february the ceo of costa cruises told residents of giglio the company would have by midmarch the plan to remove the ship he also promised to minimise harm to their tourism businesses the wreck came to rest on a rock ledge and there were concerns that she might slide into deeper water the stability and deformation of the ship was monitored by satellite imagery and surfacebased instruments although the ship was not in immediate risk of slipping from its grounded position into deeper water environment minister clini told the italian senate on february that the risk for a collapse is quite real the more time passes the weaker the hull becomes we cannot guarantee that it has not been compromised already on january scientists had become very concerned that the ship had moved centimetres in over six hours that day on february the ship shifted centimetres in during seven hours shifts and any high winds and high seas caused suspension of recovery and salvage operations on february civil protection director gabrielli confirmed that the data registered is absent of anomalies another report based on sonar and laser measurements and an ispra underwater video indicated that the ship might collapse in its midsection because its weight was not supported between the rock spur supporting the bow and the rock spur supporting the stern and said at the time that both of those rocks had now started crumbling dramatically civil protection director gabrielli stated that report was reassuring in that it shows that a part of the seabed has got into the hull basically increasing the ships stability it was also found that the hull was slowly collapsing under its own weight making salvage more difficult and expensive salvageedit all operations planned for the wreck including defuelling were conducted jointly by costa cruises and the concordia emergency commissioners office on february after weeks of weather delays dutch salvage firm smit internationale acting jointly with italian company neri spa started removing the vessels tonnes of heavy fuel oil the tanks that contained about of the fuel in the vessel were emptied first and expected to take about days the second phase involved the engine room which had nearly cubic metres of diesel fuel and other lubricants the offloading process required fixing valves to the underwater fuel tanks one on top one on the bottom hoses were then attached to the valves and as the oil warmed to make it less viscous was pumped out of the upper hose and into a nearby ship replacing it with sea water pumped in through the lower hose to fill the space so as not to affect the ships balance a technique known as hottapping costa concordia partially refloated as of july following the conclusion of the righting operation the ship was kept on a platform while further inspections were made and the starboard sponsons attached on october a million option was taken with dockwise for the use of the worlds largest semisubmersible heavy lift vessel dockwise vanguard to transport costa concordia as an alternative to conventional towing in december invitations were issued by costa to twelve companies to tender for the dismantling of costa concordia in france italy norway turkey and the uk on june the italian government endorsed costas decision to have the vessel dismantled at genoa by italian companies saipem mariotti and san giorgio on february a spanish diver working on the costa concordia wreck died after slashing his leg on a sheet of metal he was brought to the surface alive by a fellow diver but later died the name of the deceased has not been released by authorities this was the only death to occur during the costa concordia salvage operation on july salvage operators refloated costa concordia off its submerged platform and towed the ship laterally a short distance away from the coast as of july the ship had refloated meters from its supporting platform with meters remaining on july the costa concordia began her final journey to the port of genoa list of costa concordia

convicted over the cruise disaster the sentences for the defendants range from two years and months to months the trial of codefendant capt francesco schettino began this week people died in january when the cruise liner ran aground and turned on its side rome cnn five people were convicted of multiple manslaughter and causing personal injury saturday over the deadly wreck of the costa concordia cruise liner off the italian coast last year but only two may serve any prison time under the plea bargain accepted by the judge the convictions the first in the case came after judge pietro molino accepted their plea bargain saturday morning the five were originally codefendants with the cruise ships captain francesco schettino but he is now being tried separately on charges of multiple manslaughter in the wreck and abandoning ship court proceedings in his case began this week thirtytwo people died when the costa concordia a luxury liner carrying passengers and crew members struck

not at the end but we are at a critical moment giglio mayor sergio ortelli told reporters for months engineers have been hard at work attaching metal boxes to either side of the ship after draining water from the boxes they had to pump compressed air into its place to get the ship to float it was a dangerous and tricky procedure the ship is rotting and theres a real risk the bottom of it could give way by lunchtime monday the ship had been moved meters about feet as part of an initial meter feet shift to the east the shift dramatically changed the appearance of the wreck from land after meters the ship will be anchored and operations will cease for monday on tuesday five steel hollow boxes or sponsons will be lowered and divers will begin attaching more chains and cables to help reinforce the bottom of the boat once thats done theyll raise the ship deck by deck clearing any debris along the way after the ship is completely floated a convoy of boats will then begin a potentially treacherous journey the ship will be towed slowly and carefully kilometers miles to genoa italian environment minister gian luca galletti told the media that the operation marked the closure of a dark moment in italy he said it would have been too dangerous to leave the costa concordia in the same position for another year we could have dismantled the concordia in situ but they chose to take the more expensive riskier route to tow it away to save the environment of giglio galletti said officials said its likely the towing process wont start for days due to port restrictions

and an integral part of the community chinuas mother and sister zinobia uzoma told him many stories as a child which he repeatedly requested his education was furthered by the collages his father hung on the walls of their home as well as almanacs and numerous books including a prose adaptation of a midsummer nights dream c and an igbo version of the pilgrims progress chinua also eagerly anticipated traditional village events like the frequent masquerade ceremonies which he recreated later in his novels and stories educationedit in achebe entered st philips central school despite his protests he spent a week in the religious class for young children but was quickly moved to a higher class when the schools chaplain took note of his intelligence one teacher described him as the student with the best handwriting in class and the best reading skills he also attended sunday school every week and the special evangelical services held monthly often carrying his fathers bag a controversy erupted at one such session when apostates from the new church challenged the catechist about the tenets of christianity achebe later included a scene from this incident in things fall apart at the age of twelve achebe moved away from his family to the village of nekede four kilometres from owerri he enrolled as a student at the central school where his older brother john taught in nekede achebe gained an appreciation for mbari a traditional art form which seeks to invoke the gods protection through symbolic sacrifices in the form of sculpture and collage when the time came to change to secondary school in achebe sat entrance examinations for and was accepted at both the prestigious dennis memorial grammar school in onitsha and the even more prestigious government college in umuahia modelled on the british public school and funded by the colonial administration government college had been established in to educate nigerias future elite it had rigorous academic standards and was vigorously elitist accepting boys purely on the basis of ability the language of the school was english not only to develop proficiency but also to provide a common tongue for pupils from different nigerian language groups achebe described this later as being ordered to put away their different mother tongues and communicate in the language of their colonisers the rule was strictly enforced and achebe recalls that his first punishment was for asking another boy to pass the soap in igbo once there achebe was doublepromoted in his first year completing the first two years studies in one and spending only four years in secondary school instead of the standard five achebe was unsuited to the schools sports regimen and belonged instead to a group of six exceedingly studious pupils so intense were their study habits that the headmaster banned the reading of textbooks from five to six oclock in the afternoon though other activities and other books were allowed achebe started to explore the schools wonderful library there he discovered booker t washingtons up from slavery the autobiography of an american former slave achebe found it sad but it showed him another dimension of reality he also read classic novels such as gullivers travels david copperfield and treasure island together with tales of colonial derringdo such as h rider haggards allan quatermain and john buchans prester john achebe later recalled that as a reader he took sides with the white characters against the savages and even developed a dislike for africans the white man was good and reasonable and intelligent and courageous the savages arrayed against him were sinister and stupid or at the most cunning i hated their guts universityedit lagos in the nbs a radio network started in by the colonial government assigned achebe to the talks department preparing scripts for oral delivery this helped him master the subtle nuances between written and spoken language a skill that helped him later to write realistic dialogue the city of lagos also made a significant impression on him a huge conurbation the city teemed with recent migrants from the rural villages achebe revelled in the social and political activity around him and later drew upon his experiences when describing the city in his novel no longer at ease while in lagos achebe started work on a novel this was challenging since very little african fiction had been written in english although amos tutuolas palmwine drinkard and cyprian ekwensis people of the city were notable exceptions while appreciating ekwensis work achebe worked hard to develop his own style even as he pioneered the creation of the nigerian novel itself a visit to nigeria by queen elizabeth ii in brought issues of colonialism and politics to the surface and was a significant moment for achebe also in he was selected at the staff school run by the british broadcasting corporation bbc his first trip outside nigeria was an opportunity to advance his technical production skills and to solicit feedback on his novel which was later split into two books in london he met a novelist named gilbert phelps to whom he offered the manuscript phelps responded with great enthusiasm asking achebe if he could show it to his editor and publishers achebe declined insisting that it needed more work things fall apartedit a map of the distribution of people using the swahili language later that year achebe was awarded a rockefeller fellowship for six months of travel which he called the first important perk of my writing career achebe set out for a tour of east africa one month after nigeria achieved its independence he travelled to kenya where he was required to complete an immigration form by checking a box indicating his ethnicity european asiatic arab or other shocked and dismayed at being forced into an other identity he found the situation almost funny and took an extra form as a souvenir continuing to tanganyika and zanzibar now united in tanzania he was frustrated by the paternalistic attitude he observed among nonafrican hotel clerks and social elites achebe also found in his travels that swahili was gaining prominence as a major african language radio programs were broadcast in swahili and its use was widespread in the countries he visited nevertheless he also found an apathy among the people toward literature written in swahili he met the poet sheikh shaaban robert who complained of the difficulty he had faced in trying to publish his swahililanguage work in northern rhodesia now called zambia achebe found himself sitting in a whitesonly section of a bus to victoria falls interrogated by the ticket taker as to why he was sitting in the front he replied if you must know i come from nigeria and there we sit where we like in the bus upon reaching the waterfall he was cheered by the black travellers from the bus but he was saddened by their being unable to resist the policy of segregation at the time two years later achebe again left nigeria this time as part of a fellowship for creative artists awarded by unesco he travelled to the united states and brazil he met with a number of writers from the us including novelists ralph ellison and arthur miller in brazil he met with several other authors with whom he discussed the complications of writing in portuguese achebe worried that the vibrant literature of the nation would be lost if left untranslated into a more widely spoken language voice of nigeria and african writers seriesedit once he returned to nigeria achebe was promoted at the nbs to the position of director of external broadcasting one of his first duties was to help create the voice of nigeria network the station broadcast its first transmission on new years day and worked to maintain an objective perspective during the turbulent era immediately following independence this objectivity was put to the test when nigerian prime minister abubakar tafawa balewa declared a state of emergency in the western region responding to a series of conflicts between officials of varying parties achebe became saddened by the evidence of corruption and silencing of political opposition in he attended an executive conference of african writers in english at the makerere university college in kampala uganda he met with important literary figures from around the continent and the world including ghanaian poet kofi awoonor nigerian playwright and poet wole soyinka and us poetauthor langston hughes among the topics of discussion was an attempt to determine whether the term african literature ought to include work from the diaspora or solely that writing composed by people living within the continent itself achebe indicated that it was not a very significant question and that scholars would do well to wait until a body of work were large enough to judge writing about the conference in several journals achebe hailed it as a milestone for the literature of africa and highlighted the importance of community among isolated voices on the continent and beyond map of the biafra secession nigeriabiafra waredit in may the southeastern region of nigeria broke away to form the republic of biafra in july the nigerian military attacked to suppress what it considered an unlawful rebellion achebes partner christopher okigbo who had become a close friend of the family especially of achebes son young ikechukwu volunteered to join the secessionist army while simultaneously working at the press achebes house was bombed one afternoon christie had taken the children to visit her sick mother so the only victims were his books and papers the achebe family narrowly escaped disaster several times during the war five days later christopher okigbo was killed on the wars front line achebe was shaken considerably by the loss in he wrote dirge for okigbo originally in the igbo language but later translated to english as the war intensified the achebe family was forced to leave enugu for the biafran capital of aba as the turmoil closed in he continued to write but most of his creative work during the war took the form of poetry the shorter format was a consequence of living in a war zone i can write poetry he said something short intense more in keeping with my mood all this is creating in the context of our struggle many of these poems were collected in his book beware soul brother one of his most famous refugee mother and child spoke to the suffering and loss that surrounded him dedicated to the promise of biafra he accepted a request to serve as foreign ambassador refusing an invitation from the program of african studies at northwestern university in the us achebe traveled to many cities in europe including london where he continued his work with the african writers series project at heinemann during the war relations between writers in nigeria and biafra were strained achebe and john pepper clark had a tense confrontation in london over their respective support for opposing sides of the conflict achebe demanded that the publisher withdraw the dedication of a man of the people he had given to clark years later their friendship healed and the dedication was restored meanwhile their contemporary wole soyinka was imprisoned for meeting with biafran officials and spent many years in jail speaking in achebe said i find the nigerian situation untenable if i had been a nigerian i think i would have been in the same situation as wole soyinka is in prison the nigerian government under the leadership of general yakubu gowon was backed by the british government the two nations enjoyed a vigorous trade partnership addressing the causes of the war in achebe lashed out at the nigerian political and military forces that had forced biafra to secede he framed the conflict in terms of the countrys colonial past the writer in nigeria he said found that the independence his country was supposed to have won was totally without content the old white master was still in power he had got himself a bunch of black stooges to do his dirty work for a commission the university of massachusetts amherst at night the university of massachusetts amherst offered achebe a professorship later that year and the family moved to the united states their youngest daughter was displeased with her nursery school and the family soon learned that her frustration involved language achebe helped her face the alien experience as he called it by telling her stories during the car trips to and from school as he presented his lessons to a wide variety of students he taught only one class to a large audience he began to study the perceptions of africa in western scholarship africa is not like anywhere else they know there are no real people in the dark continent only forces operating and people dont speak any language you can understand they just grunt too busy jumping up and down in a frenzy criticism of conradedit achebe expanded this criticism when he presented a chancellors lecture at amherst on february an image of africa racism in conrads heart of darkness decrying joseph conrad as a bloody racist achebe asserted that conrads famous novel dehumanises africans rendering africa as a metaphysical battlefield devoid of all recognisable humanity into which the wandering european enters at his peril achebe also discussed a quotation from albert schweitzer a nobel peace prize laureate that extraordinary missionary albert schweitzer who sacrificed brilliant careers in music and theology in europe for a life of service to africans in much the same area as conrad writes about epitomizes the ambivalence in a comment which has often been quoted schweitzer says the african is indeed my brother but my junior brother and so he proceeded to build a hospital appropriate to the needs of junior brothers with standards of hygiene reminiscent of medical practice in the days before the germ theory of disease came into being some were surprised that achebe would challenge a man honoured in the west for his reverence for life and recognised as a paragon of western liberalism the lecture caused a storm of controversy even at the reception immediately following his talk many english professors in attendance were upset by his remarks one elderly professor reportedly approached him said how dare you and stormed away another suggested that achebe had no sense of humour but several days later achebe was approached by a third professor who told him i now realize that i had never really read heart of darkness although i have taught it for years although the lecture angered many of his colleagues he was nevertheless presented later in with an honorary doctorate from the university of stirling and the lotus prize for afroasian writers the first comprehensive rebuttal of achebes critique was published in by british critic cedric watts his essay a bloody racist about achebes view of conrad defends heart of darkness as an antiimperialist novel suggesting that part of its greatness lies in the power of its criticisms of racial prejudice palestinianamerican theorist edward said agreed in his book culture and imperialism that conrad criticised imperialism but added as a creature of his time conrad could not grant the natives their freedom despite his severe critique of the imperialism that enslaved them achebes criticism has become a mainstream perspective on conrads work the essay was included in the norton critical edition of conrads novel editor robert kimbrough called it one of the three most important events in heart of darkness criticism since the second edition of his book critic nicolas tredell divides conrad criticism into two epochal phases before and after achebe asked frequently about his essay achebe once explained that he never meant for the work to be abandoned its not in my nature to talk about banning books i am saying read it with the kind of understanding and with the knowledge i talk about and read it beside african works interviewed on national public radio with robert siegel in october achebe remains consistent although tempering this criticism in a discussion entitled heart of darkness is inappropriate conrad was a seductive writer he could pull his reader into the fray and if it were not for what he said about me and my people i would probably be thinking only of that seduction retirement and politicsedit when he returned to the university of kenya in he hoped to accomplish three goals finish the novel he had been writing renew the native publication of okike and further his study of igbo culture he also showed that he would not restrict his criticism to european targets in an august interview he lashed out at the archetypal nigerian intellectual who is divorced from the intellect but for two things status and stomach and if theres any danger that he might suffer official displeasure or lose his job he would prefer to turn a blind eye to what is happening around him in october achebe was awarded the firstever nigerian national merit award stone row at the centre of the bard college campus on march achebe was riding in a car to lagos when an axle collapsed and the car flipped his son ikechukwu and the driver suffered minor injuries but the weight of the vehicle fell on achebe and his spine was severely damaged he was flown to the paddocks hospital in buckinghamshire england and treated for his injuries in july doctors announced that although he was recuperating well he was paralyzed from the waist down and would require the use of a wheelchair for the rest of his life soon afterwards achebe became the charles p stevenson professor of languages and literature at bard college in annandaleonhudson new york he held the position for more than fifteen years in the autumn of he joined the brown university faculty as the david and marianna fisher university professor of africana studies later life and deathedit in october the london financial times reported that achebe was planning to write a novella for the canongate myth series a series of short novels in which ancient myths from myriad cultures are reimagined and rewritten by contemporary authors achebes novella has not yet been scheduled for publication in june achebe was awarded the man booker international prize the judging panel included us critic elaine showalter who said he illuminated the path for writers around the world seeking new words and forms for new realities and societies and south african writer nadine gordimer who said achebe has achieved what one of his characters brilliantly defines as the writers purpose a newfound utterance for the capture of lifes complexity in achebe was awarded the dorothy and lillian gish prize for one of the richest prizes for the arts in october achebes publishers penguin books released there was a country a personal history of biafra publication immediately caused a stir and reopened the discussion about the nigerian civil war it would prove to be the last publication during his lifetime fondly called the grandfather of nigerian literature achebe died after a short illness on march in boston united states an unidentified source close to the family said that he was ill for a while and had been hospitalised in the city penguin publishing director simon winder said we are all desolate to hear of his death the new york times described him in his obituary as one of africas most widely read novelists and one of the continents towering men of letters the bbc wrote that he was revered throughout the world for his depiction of life in africa styleedit oral traditionedit the style of achebes fiction draws heavily on the oral tradition of the igbo people he weaves folk tales into the fabric of his stories illuminating community values in both the content and the form of the storytelling the tale about the earth and sky in things fall apart for example emphasises the interdependency of the masculine and the feminine although nwoye enjoys hearing his mother tell the tale okonkwos dislike for it is evidence of his imbalance later nwoye avoids beatings from his father by pretending to dislike such womens stories a stamp from southern colonial nigeria culture and colonialismedit a prevalent theme in achebes novels is the intersection of african tradition particularly igbo varieties and modernity especially as embodied by european colonialism the village of umuofia in things fall apart for example is violently shaken with internal divisions when the white christian missionaries arrive nigerian english professor ernest n emenyonu describes the colonial experience in the novel as the systematic emasculation of the entire culture achebe later embodied this tension between african tradition and western influence in the figure of sam okoli the president of kangan in anthills of the savannah distanced from the myths and tales of the community by his westernised education he does not have the capacity for reconnection shown by the character beatrice the colonial impact on the igbo in achebes novels is often effected by individuals from europe but institutions and urban offices frequently serve a similar purpose the character of obi in no longer at ease succumbs to colonialera corruption in the city the temptations of his position overwhelm his identity and fortitude the courts and the position of district commissioner in things fall apart likewise clash with the traditions of the igbo and remove their ability to participate in structures of decisionmaking the standard achebean ending results in the destruction of an individual and by synecdoche the downfall of the community odilis descent into the luxury of corruption and hedonism in a man of the people for example is symbolic of the postcolonial crisis in nigeria and elsewhere even with the emphasis on colonialism however achebes tragic endings embody the traditional confluence of fate individual and society as represented by sophocles and shakespeare still achebe seeks to portray neither moral absolutes nor a fatalistic inevitability in he said i never will take the stand that the old must win or that the new must win the point is that no single truth satisfied meand this is well founded in the ibo world view no single man can be correct all the time no single idea can be totally correct his perspective is reflected in the words of ikem a character in anthills of the savannah whatever you are is never enough you must find a way to accept something however small from the other to make you whole and to save you from the mortal sin of righteousness and extremism and in a interview achebe said belief in either radicalism or orthodoxy is too simplified a way of viewing things evil is never all evil goodness on the other hand is often tainted with selfishness masculinity and femininityedit the gender roles of men and women as well as societies conceptions of the associated concepts are frequent themes in achebes writing he has been criticised as a sexist author in response to what many call the uncritical depiction of traditionally patriarchal igbo society where the most masculine men take numerous wives and women are beaten regularly others suggest that achebe is merely representing the limited gendered vision of the characters and they note that in his later works he tries to demonstrate the inherent dangers of excluding women from society in things fall apart okonkwos furious manhood overpowers everything feminine in his life including his own conscience for example when he feels bad after being forced to kill his adopted son he asks himself when did you become a shivering old woman he views all things feminine as distasteful in part because they remind him of his fathers laziness and cowardice the women in the novel meanwhile are obedient quiet and absent from positions of authority despite the fact that igbo women were traditionally involved in village leadership nevertheless the need for feminine balance is highlighted by ani the earth goddess and the extended discussion of nneka mother is supreme in chapter fourteen okonkwos defeat is seen by some as a vindication of the need for a balancing feminine ethos achebe has expressed frustration at frequently being misunderstood on this point saying that i want to sort of scream that things fall apart is on the side of women and that okonkwo is paying the penalty for his treatment of women that all his problems all the things he did wrong can be seen as offenses against the feminine achebes first central female character in a novel is beatrice nwanyibuife in anthills of the savannah as an independent woman in the city beatrice strives for the balance that okonkwo lacked so severely she refutes the notion that she needs a man and slowly learns about idemili a goddess balancing the aggression of male power although the final stages of the novel show her functioning in a nurturing mothertype role beatrice remains firm in her conviction that women should not be limited to such capacities legacyedit achebe has been called the father of modern african writing and many books and essays have been written about his work over the past fifty years in he became the first living writer to be represented in the everymans library collection published by alfred a knopf his th birthday was celebrated at the university of nigeria by an international whos who in african literature one observer noted nothing like it had ever happened before in african literature anywhere on the continent many writers of succeeding generationswho view his work as having paved the way for their efforts in achebe was awarded an honorary degree from the university of kent at the ceremony professor robert gibson said that the nigerian writer is now revered as master by the younger generation of african writers and it is to him they regularly turn for counsel and inspiration even outside of africa his impact resonates strongly in literary circles novelist margaret atwood called him a magical writer one of the greatest of the twentieth century poet maya angelou lauded things fall apart as a book wherein all readers meet their brothers sisters parents and friends and themselves along nigerian roads nelson mandela recalling his time as a political prisoner once referred to achebe as a writer in whose company the prison walls fell down achebe was the recipient of over honorary degrees from universities in england scotland canada south africa nigeria and the united states including dartmouth college harvard and brown university he was awarded the commonwealth poetry prize an honorary fellowship of the american academy of arts and letters a foreign honorary member of the american academy of arts and sciences the nigerian national order of merit nigerias highest honour for academic work the peace prize of the german book trade the man booker international prize and the dorothy and lillian gish prize are two of the more recent accolades achebe received he twice refused the nigerian honour commander of the federal republic in and saying i have watched particularly the chaos in my own state of anambra where a small clique of renegades openly boasting its connections in high places seems determined to turn my homeland into a bankrupt and lawless fiefdom i am appalled by the brazenness of this clique and the silence if not connivance of the presidency some scholarswho have suggested that achebe was shunned by intellectual society for criticising conrad and traditions of racism in the west despite his scholarly achievements and the global importance of his work achebe never received a nobel prize which some observers viewed as unjust when wole soyinka was awarded the nobel prize in literature achebe joined the rest of nigeria in

twitter facebook and others in recent hacks still no word monday on how long hackers had access cnn tens of millions of online notetakers found themselves worrying about their security monday as questions remained about a weekend hack of evernote the online notetaking and archiving service began requiring its million users to reset their passwords saturday after announcing it was the victim of a security breach making it the latest tech company in recent weeks to fall victim to hackers in a blog post the californiabased company said its security team has discovered and blocked suspicious activity on the evernote network that appears to have been a coordinated attempt to access secure areas of the evernote service the company said no user content or financial information was accessed but the hackers were able to access user information including user names email addresses and encrypted passwords quest keep safe from hackaroonies evernote said the encryption coding they use to protect passwords is robust but still sent the password warning to users of the service which is popular among college students and others who rely on taking notes for later use sophos security analyst graham cluley said in a blog post that it remains unclear how long the hackers had access to evernote and how they managed to get in whats not good news he wrote is that the hackers now have access to the usernames and email addresses of evernote customers it is easy to imagine how this information could be abused for instance the hackers could send out spam emails to those users claiming to come from evernote and trick them into visiting a malicious website and of course its another cautionary tale about the risks which can exist with trusting the cloud to look after your personal information like many services evernote stores data on remote servers instead of the users computer this allows them to be accessed from multiple computers and other devices evernote warned users of the possibilities cluley noted he argued that their message warning users not to click phony security emails while sending out a security email of their own could confuse users complicating matters is that the legitimate evernote email pushes users first to a website with the domain name mkt before taking them to evernote itself cluley wrote that this is a service evernote is likely using to track how many of its users changed their passwords and says not to worry thats a technique commonly used in a normal marketing email communications but looks very out of place in an email about a security breach which tries to hammer home the point to never click on resetpassword requests in emails he said last week customer support tool zendesk announced it was hacked with the breach exposing the email addresses of users of three other websites tumblr pinterest and twitter all of which use zendesk microsoft apple and facebook last month said they were the victim of hackers and twitter said in january that it too was hacked reports that surfaced last week suggested that a gang of hackers based in eastern europe was behind at least some of the attacks using a website frequented by developers

evernote has used a single signon sso model where users authenticate to the evernote service and an authentication token is passed to the thirdparty site for access into the forum the thirdparty never sees or stores an evernote users password just last week the evernote service was disrupted by a denialofservice attack which the company announced on the afternoon of june the issue affected the

able to retrieve our forum members profile information we dont believe that the hacker accessed any private forum messages evernote said in an email sent to each forum member that was affected if you

ap photoariana cubillos late sunday acting venezuelan president nicolas maduro declared victory in the countrys first presidential election since the death of longtime leader hugo chavez the national election commission had just released the results much closer than the polls had foretold maduro percent henriquecapriles percent while maduro was celebrating capriles was calling fraud mdash and tweeting alertamos al paiacutes y al mundo la intencioacuten de querer cambiar la voluntad expresada por el pueblohacer rt a este mensaje mdash henrique capriles r hcapriles april that message mdash we alert the country and the world of the intent to change the will of the people mdash was followed by a speech to supporters i want the truth to be known capriles said we are going to do everything in our power to reveal it mr maduro if you were illegitimate before now you definitely are he demanded a hand recount maduro agreed to an audit of the results by the national electoral council which earlier had declared the results irreversible maduro the cubatrained ideologue and the man the cancerstricken chavez anointed as his heir in december was always slated to win on chavezs coattails says mary anastasia ogrady atthe wall street journal the state of the economy and rampant crime mean that in a fair fight the yearold capriles might have won easily but of course between cuban agents and the chavez machine the fight was never a fair one that makes the closeness of the election all that much more remarkable says irene caselli at bbc news but chavez supporters werent all that worried about the narrow margin of victory screaming and chanting took over beer was thrown into the air people hugged each other nobody seemed to mind if the victory was narrow this victory is dedicated to hugo chavez our commander my vote went to him said one woman bbc news elections dont come much closer andcapriles isnt going to cede this one without a fight says the economist but even for those who accept the official result the government candidates victory looked remarkably like a defeat with a tiny votes separating the two candidates according to the official tally maduro managed in a day campaign to squander almost all the millionvote advantage that chavez had obtained over capriles just six months ago and governing wont be all that easy either maduros political capital consisted almost exclusively of the late presidents endorsement he faces an uphill struggle to impose his authority on a factionridden chavista movement that was hitherto held together by the unquestioned authority of chavez himself maduros narrow victory which many even on his own side will see as a defeat makes that task all the more difficult capriles task is not much easier although he has consolidated his status as the undisputed leader of the venezuelan opposition he will now be under pressure to prove his claim that he was cheated of victory with no independent institutions to turn to his battle will be a political rather than a legal one economist the only thing that seems clear is that with chavez gone venezuela is on the cusp of a new era says the economist venezuela is obviously bitterly and almost evenly divided maduro will probably hang on to power for at least a few years but hell almost certainly find that his difficult election marks the beginning of an even

were announced to suggest a quotpactquot and that maduro refused capriles camp did not comment on maduros claim maduro a longtime foreign minister to chavez rode a wave of sympathy for the charismatic leader to victory pinning his hopes on the immense loyalty for his boss among millions of poor beneficiaries of government largesse and the powerful state apparatus that chavez skillfully consolidated capriles main campaign weapon was to simply emphasize quotthe incompetence of the statequot millions of venezuelans were lifted out of poverty under chavez but many also believe his government not only squandered but plundered much of the trillion in oil revenues during his year rule venezuelans are afflicted by chronic power outages crumbling infrastructure unfinished public works projects doubledigit inflation food and medicine shortages and rampant crime one of the worlds highest homicide and kidnapping rates that the opposition said worsened after chavez disappeared to cuba in december for what would be his final surgery analyst david smilde at the washington office on latin america think tank predicted the victory would prove pyrrhic and make maduro extremely vulnerable quotit will make people in his coalition think that perhaps he is not the one to lead the revolution forwardquot smilde said capriles camp said chavista loyalists in the judiciary put them at glaring disadvantage by slapping the campaign and broadcast media with fines and prosecutions that they called unwarranted only one opposition tv station remains and it was being sold to a new owner monday at

accorded chavez maduro hit back hard at one point calling capriles backers quotheirs of hitlerquot it was an odd accusation considering that capriles is the grandson of holocaust survivors from poland

zoos and breeding centers around the world most of these pandas are in china watch the panda cam giant pandas mei xiang and tian tian are at the national zoo under a giant panda cooperative research and breeding agreement signed in january between the zoo and the china wildlife conservation association this extends the zoorsquos giant panda program through mei and tian are the focus of an

enrichmentpanda photo gallerysupport panda conservation september scientists at the smithsonian conservation biology institutersquos center for conservation and evolutionary genetics confirmed that our giant panda cub is female a paternity analysis showed that the zoorsquos panda tian tian is the cubrsquos father scientists also confirmed the second stillborn cub mei xiang delivered on august was a female and also sired by tian tian the cubs were fraternal twins zoo scientists used two tests to confirm the sex of both cubs the first test was developed by scientists in china and analyzes a fragment of the zinc finger protein gene the second test also using a shorter fragment of the same zinc finger protein gene was developed by scbi scientists and veterinarians they used the second test to verify the results of the initial test september this morning mei xiang was very alert when the panda keepers walked into her den and looked eager for her morning drink she drank ounces of water right away she did turn down all offers of food a frozen bamboo shoot and sugar cane she seems to be enjoying her ldquoden servicerdquo we only freeze semen from endangered species that is highquality the process for freezing samples is very specific to ensure that the samples are the highest quality possible first the semen has to be mixed with a solution that prevents ph variations otherwise those variations would kill the small and fragile cells then an antifreeze agent glycerol is added to the diluted semen to protect the cells before being exposed to decreasing temperatures ideally the semen is first cooled to c which is the temperature of a refrigerator in a couple of hours the cold semen suspension is then loaded in small plastic straws that hold less than ml of semen all of the straws hold the same concentration of semen finally the straws are exposed for several minutes to liquid nitrogen vapors at a temperature of about c before being plunged in the liquid nitrogen c we dont always have to use frozen sperm for giant panda artificial inseminations we can use fresh samples but only highquality fresh semen we know if fresh semen is highquality based on how many moving spermatozoa are in the sample after we collect a fresh semen sample it has to be either used for an insemination or frozen immediately otherwise the sperm cells start to die they stop moving the forward motility of the sperm cells which we can see using a microscope is the best indicator of their quality and viability february in addition to the research zoo scientists and their chinese colleagues conduct on giant pandas they also study red pandas in this update dr copper aitkenpalmer lead veterinarian at the smithsonian conservation biology institutes department of conservation medicine writes about the research zoo scientists are currently doing with red pandas in november the smithsonian conservation biology institute launched the largest health and reproductive study ever on the red panda this study is evaluating the largest red panda population housed under human care at the chengdu research base of giant panda breeding panda base in chengdu china a significant number of the red pandas at the panda base are involved in the study scbis department of conservation medicine is working with experts at the panda base and george mason university to conduct a biomedical survey of red pandas mehgan murphysmithsonians national zoo the red panda is the only member of the family aluridae making it a unique species unlike any other carnivore on the planet although a very different species than the similarly named giant panda red pandas share their habitat with the giant panda scbi is interested in evaluating diseases of special species that share habitat with the giant panda specifically in the sichuan region of china as part of a broader project initiated by the scbis department of conservation medicine called the giant panda comparative medicine and disease susceptibility initiative our red pandas at scbis headquarters in front royal virginia are also in the study five red pandas live at scbi in front royal and one red panda shama lives at the zoo chengdu houses the most red pandas of any facility in the world february dr copper aitkenpalmer is the lead veterinarian at the smithsonian conservation biology institutes department of conservation medicine in the past few months she and other zoo scientists have traveled to china for different giant panda conservation initatives below she writes about some of their trips the past few months have been very busy in november i traveled to china with dr elizabeth freeman from george mason university thanks to a donation from the ford motor company fund for the annual giant panda technical meeting in chengdu china the technical meeting is a twotofourday meeting that is hosted annually in china all of the giant panda scientists worldwide go which is probably around people during the meeting we participated in discussions with giant panda experts in china on current reintroduction projects emerging giant panda health concerns and reproductive studies chinese scientists are working exclusively on the reintroduction projects but it was interesting to hear what they have been doing last year one young male panda was introduced into the wild he was born in captivity but his mother was born in the wild that was part of a cwca chinese wildlife conservation administration project and one of our very own scbi scientists jon ballou talked about giant panda genetics each presentation was given in both english and chinese thanks to the help of translators my presentation was translated simultaneously into chinese as i was speaking photo courtesy of janice sveda in december the month after the giant panda technical meeting david m rubenstein fellow andrea lee traveled to china to present the preliminary results of the giant panda parasite study conducted with chinese veterinary experts in giant panda health this study was conducted during the fall of at bifengxia giant panda center cwca round worms are the biggest problem we have found but we will continue to conduct parasite studies for the next five years additionally she continued collecting red panda health data working with veterinarians at the chengdu research base of giant panda breeding last month kendall bilbrey a graduate of the smithsonianmason school of conservation joined the scbi team to continue data collection for the ford motor company funds giant panda comparative medicine and disease susceptibility initiative this is a longterm collaborative effort between cwca scbis department of conservation medicine and george mason university to learn more about health and disease of the giant panda finally this month i started working with andrea lee a veterinary biotechnologist and kendall bilbrey in preparation for a trip to china in march this trip will be part of the ford motor company fundrsquos giant panda comparative medicine and disease susceptibility initiative well keep you updated on our research in the coming months february over the next few months well be bringing you giant panda updates that will focus on mei xiang and tian tian and the research zoo scientists conduct related to giant pandas around the world youll be hearing from many different experts at the zoo and the smithsonian conservation biology institute the update below about mei xiang and tian tian was written by giant panda keeper nicole maccorkle we are starting to see slight changes in mei xiangs and tian tians behavior as well as some physical changes there have not been any changes in mei xiangs hormones yet however this information taken together and compared against previous years data tells us that breeding season will most likely be between midmarch and midapril if things continue along the current trajectory keep in mind however that this is only an estimate and that a female giant pandas estrus can vary greatly from season to season as mei xiang has shown us in the past our breeding plan for this year is the same as last year were entering this breeding season with renewed optimism mei xiang has proven that an older female who hasnt had a cub in many years can indeed become pregnant she also reminded us that she continues to be an excellent mother in the spirit of valentines day watch a special video from juan a giant panda keeper at the zoo explain about breeding season at the zoo if youre looking for the perfect valentine for the love of your life you can

critter cupids are recommended for adults as breeding is discussed in the video message other species including california sea lion and asian smallclawed otter critter cupids are available to send to children family or friends january mei xiangs den has been transformed for the new breeding season observant panda cam viewers have no doubt seen the difference in the configuration of the barred barriers by shifting the angle of the bars keepers will be able to have more direct access to mei xiang and future cubs while they are resting in the nest area the old bars were recycled making the renovations not only a little greener but also a little less overwhelming for mei xiang it was as if the furniture was simply rearranged one day keepers are now working on desensitization training getting her used to the new set up and getting her comfortable having keepers in close proximity to her while protected by the new barrier as we had hoped mei xiang is barely fazed by the changes and is now regularly participating in training sessions in the remodeled den january one of the biggest questions scientists at the smithsonian conservation biology institute scbi were working handinhand with their colleagues in china to understand in the late s was why are pandas lsquochallengedrsquo at reproducing almost a decade later scientists are still answering questions about giant panda reproduction but a new generation of scientists are now also contributing to scientific breakthroughs it was during the late s while surveying the major panda breeding sites in china that scbi researchers first met yan huang ldquowe met this eager young investigator who wanted to learn more about improving reproductive health and consistency in giant pandasrdquo says david wildt head of scbirsquos center for species survival wildt and the late dr jogayle howard began working with yan under their guidance yan learned many new methods for improving panda reproductive health and success they included collecting and freezethawing sperm which are vitally important for artificial inseminations ais and effectively managing pandas yan trained at scbirsquos campus at the national zoo in washington dc and its headquarters in front royal va and in china once a student yan is now making his own advances in giant panda research recently the premier reproduction journal biology of reproduction published an article about improving reproductive success in pandas yan was the lead author of the paper that details how to determine the exact date to perform an artificial insemination he worked with his chinese colleagues on his research and wildt was a collaborator knowing exactly when to perform an artificial insemination on a female giant panda is very important female giant pandas come into estrus for to hours each year which means scientists only have one brief window of opportunity to perform an ai giant panda artificial insemination at the smithsonians national zoo yan tracked reproductive hormones in urine and used dna paternity analysis to determine the best time to perform an ai on a female panda he found that the best day to do an ai coincides with the peak day of urinary estrogen production based on the dna paternity analysis yan saw that the male whose sperm was used for an ai on the peak day of urinary estrogen production in the female was the father of the femalersquos cub ldquosordquo wildt explains of yanrsquos research ldquoitrsquos all about timing doing an ai later in the short estrus is not worthwhile or a good use of frozen sperm yan is now a leader in developing new and novel methods for reintroducing pandas into the wild in sichuan province ldquohuang yan is a perfect example of what we are doing at scbi ndash creating scientists with multiple skills ndash working towards training ourselves right out of a jobrdquo one of the national zoorsquos goals is to train future generations of conservationists who will make the next major advances in conservation science this capacitybuilding extends across many species ecosystems and scientific disciplines and has resulted in powerful collaborations and important studies

enrichmentpanda photo gallerysupport panda conservation giant panda order carnivora family ursidae genus and species ailuropoda melanoleuca geographic distribution giant pandas live in a few mountain ranges in central china in sichuan shaanxi and gansu provinces they once lived in lowland areas but farming forest clearing and other development now restrict giant pandas to the mountains habitat giant pandas live in broadleaf and coniferous forests with a dense understory of bamboo at elevations between and feet torrential rains or dense mist throughout the year characterizes these forests often shrouded in heavy clouds physical description the giant panda a blackandwhite bear has a body typical of bears it has black fur on ears eye patches muzzle legs and shoulders the rest of the animals coat is white although scientists do not know why these unusual bears are black and white some speculate that the bold coloring provides effective camouflage into their shadedappled snowy and rocky surroundings the pandas thick wooly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat giant pandas have large molar teeth and strong jaw muscles for crushing tough bamboo many people find these chunky lumbering animals to be cute but giant pandas can be as dangerous as any other bear size about the size of an american black bear giant pandas stand between two and three feet tall at the shoulder on all four legs and reach four to six feet long males are larger than females weighing up to pounds in the wild females rarely reach pounds status the giant panda is listed as endangered in the world conservation unions iucns red list of threatened species there are about left in the wild more than pandas live in zoos and breeding centers around the world mostly in china life span scientists arent sure how long giant pandas live in the wild but they are sure its shorter than lifespans in zoos chinese scientists have reported zoo pandas as old as the national zoos hsinghsing died at age in diet a wild giant panda s diet is almost exclusively percent bamboo the balance consists of other grasses and occasional small rodents or musk deer fawns in zoos giant pandas eat bamboo sugar cane rice gruel a special highfiber biscuit carrots apples and sweet potatoes social structure adult giant pandas are generally solitary but they do communicate periodically through scent marks calls and occasional meetings offspring stay with their mothers from one and a half to three years the giant panda has lived in bamboo forests for several million years it is a highly specialized animal with unique adaptations feeding adaptions millions of zoo visitors enjoy watching giant pandas eat a panda usually eats while sitting upright in a pose that resembles how humans sit on the floor this posture leaves the front paws free to grasp bamboo stems with the help of a quotpseudo thumbquot formed by an elongated and enlarged wrist bone covered with a fleshy pad of skin the panda also uses its powerful jaws and strong teeth to crush the tough fibrous bamboo into bits a giant panda s digestive system is more similar to that of a carnivore than an herbivore and so much of what is eaten is passed as waste to make up for the inefficient digestion a panda needs to consume a comparatively large amount of food from to pounds of bamboo each day to get all its nutrients to obtain this much food means that a panda must spend to hours a day foraging and eating the rest of its time is spent mostly sleeping and resting water wild giant pandas get much of the water they need from bamboo a grass whose contents are about half water new bamboo shoots are about percent water but giant pandas need more water than what bamboo alone can provide so almost every day wild pandas also drink fresh water from rivers and streams that are fed by melting snowfall in high mountain peaks the temperate forests of central china where giant pandas live receive about to inches of rain and snow a year charleston west virginia a city with a similar temperate climate receives about the same amount of rain and snow an average of inches a year reproduction giant pandas reach breeding maturity between four and eight years of age they may be reproductive until about age female pandas ovulate only once a year in the spring a short period of two to three days around ovulation is the only time she is able to conceive calls and scents draw males and females to each other female giant pandas give birth between and days after mating although females may give birth to two young usually only one survives giant panda cubs may stay with their mothers for up to three years before striking out on their own this means a wild female at best can produce young only every other year in her lifetime she may successfully raise only five to eight cubs the giant pandas naturally slow breeding rate prevents a population from recovering quickly from illegal hunting habitat loss and other humanrelated causes of mortality development at birth the cub is helpless and it takes considerable effort on the mother s part to raise it a newborn cub weighs three to five ounces and is about the size of a stick of butter pink hairless and blind the cub is th the size of its mother except for a marsupial such as the kangaroo or opossum a giant panda baby is the smallest mammal newborn relative to its mothers size cubs do not open their eyes until they are six to eight weeks of age and are not mobile until three months a cub may nurse for eight to nine months a cub is nutritionally weaned at one year but not socially weaned for up to two years read more about panda cub develoment lifestyle a wild panda spends much of its day resting feeding and seeking food unlike other bears from temperate climates giant pandas do not hibernate until recently scientists thought giant pandas spent most of their lives alone with males and females meeting only during the breeding season recent studies paint a different picture in which small groups of pandas share a large territory and sometimes meet outside the breeding season much remains to be learned about the secret lives of these elusive animals and every new discovery helps scientists in their battle to save this species growth and development of giant panda cubspanda camsgiant panda factsmeet the pandaspanda cub

months old though the exact timing will depend on mei xiang and the cub will this cub go to china yes the cub will go to china after four years when will the cub get a name it is traditional to name giant panda cubs when they are days old why do you need a dna test to determine the cubs sex external genitalia in bears doesnrsquot develop until the bear is several months old we should be able to tell the sex of the cub in a few weeks the best and most reliable way to determine a bear cubrsquos sex is through dna analysis how did you determine the window for a possible birth the panda team prepared for a panda cub birth based on behaviors they saw hormones they monitored and a new test that measured mei xiangrsquos levels of prostaglandin metabolite national zoo scientists detected a secondary rise in mei xiangrsquos urinary progesterone july that rise indicated that she would give birth to a cub or experience a pseudopregnancy in to days scientists at the memphis zoo analyzed her levels of prostaglandin metabolite they determined that if mei xiang was pregnant she would give birth to a cub between august and august if she was not her pseudpregnancy would end between august and september the panda team began monitoring mei xiang hoursaday on august they began to see behaviors consistent with a pregnancy or pseudopregnancy on august when she began body licking and object cradling why did you use sperm from both tian tian and gao gao in china it is standard practice to use sperm from more than one male when artificially inseminating a female this increases the chances of fertilization and viable embryos why is mei xiang in such a small space in the wild bearsmdashincluding giant pandasmdashgive birth in small dens in chinas wolong reserve pandas make their dens in

keepers have more direct access to mei xiang and her cub while they are resting in the nest area the old bars were recycled making the renovations not only a little greener but also a little less overwhelming for mei xiang it was as if the ldquofurniturerdquo was simply rearranged one day why are the lights always on in the den why is the cam sometimes in color and sometimes in black and white it is usually dark in meis den as it would be in a wild bears den but the cams have infared and lowlight capabilities which allows her and the cub to be visible to cam viewers this is also why the cam usually looks black and white when the keepers turn on the lights the cam shows up in color except for the bears of course who are always black and white why isnt mei eating when bears give birth in the wild the mothers spend several months denned up with their cubs their focus during this time is nurturing and protecting their cubs rather than eating scientists have observed giant panda mothers in the wild go as long as a month without eating or drinking like other bears pandas seem to go through a metabolic shift during the summer months when their food intake drops up to percent this coincides with when pandas den and produce cubs like other bear species one difference to note is that other bears fast for several months during hibernation will tian tian meet the cub male pandas are not involved in the care of their cubs fathers and cubs may never encounter each other in the wild why are you performing frequent health checks on the cub this year the panda teams primary goal is always to provide mei xiang with the opportunity to raise her cub however since she gave birth to a cub last year that did not survive they will conduct health checks earlier than they ever have before the panda team includes keepers trainedvolunteer behavior watchers veterinarians and scientists in the first days of life the cub and mei xiang will be monitored hours a day via the panda cams the curator of giant pandas keepers and veterinarians will determine how many health checks the cub will receive what do you do during the health checks when the panda team conducts a health check they have a list of things to accomplish they will measure the cubrsquos body weight assess hydration take a body measurement check the oral cavity check the umbilicus check genitalia and rectal area palpate the abdominal cavity take a fecal culture take the rectal temperature listen for a heartbeat and lung sounds and collect any urine produced the team will also evaluate mei xiang and attempt to collect milk samples from her how do you swap the cub from the den mei xiangrsquos den was rearranged earlier this year to allow the panda team to get closer to her and a cub to do health checks or retrieve the cub there is a barrier in the den which keeps members of the panda team safe when they enter the den with mei xiang and the cub mei xiang and the keepers are never on the same side of the barrier when the panda team removes the cub from the den for a health check a minimum of two keepers are always present no more than three keepers enter the den at the same time one keeper focuses on retrieving the cub and another keeper monitors mei xiang keepers offered mei xiang bamboo juice sugarcane or honey water while they retrieved the cub during the first weeks of her life now that mei xiang is leaving the cub more frequently for longer periods of time keepers can retrieve her from the den while mei is eating in the adjacent enclosure they will pick the cub up with a gloved hand why

del marmo prison for minors cnsreutersl osservatore romano david gibson religion news service apr printemailpdf on thursday evening in a familiar reprise of an ancient rite bishop robert morlino of madison wis will wash the feet of men all seminarians a recreation of jesus action at the last supper when he washed the feet of his disciples and according to catholic doctrine formally instituted the priesthood that same evening thousands of miles away pope francis will also observe the holy thursday rite though not in a cathedral like morlino but at a center for people with disabilities there he will wash the feet of a number of residents all laypeople perhaps some of them women and even nonchristians or nonbelievers francis did something similar last year shortly after his election when he stunned church observers by traveling to a juvenile detention center outside rome and washing the feet of young people two of them women and two of them muslims more than a few traditionminded catholics were aghast at the popes example and they welcomed morlinos effort to hold the line against innovations at least in his wisconsin diocese the churchs law says that only men may be the recipients of this foot washing wrote fr john zuhlsdorf a scrappy blogger popular with the catholic right morlinos guidelines that his priests must wash the feet of men or not do the foot washing at all do nothing but reiterate the churchs laws which bishops and priests are obliged to follow explore our current edition watch the video here so whos correct is the pope a dissenter or are morlino and others being legalistic what does the foot washing ritual represent anyway there are no simple answers to those questions though the weight of history and custom not to mention authority seems to be on the popes side an ancient rite accounts of christian footwashing rituals go back as far as the sixth century as peter jeffrey writes in his book a new commandment toward a renewed rite for the washing of feet there were generally two forms the mandatum pauperam or washing of the feet of poor people and the mandatum fratrum the washing of the feet of the brothers neither were part of the holy thursday liturgy and popes and clerics routinely washed the feet of poor people as a sign of service and humility in convents as well woman washed feet and had their feet washed and they washed the feet of guests and children said rita ferrone the author of several books about liturgy and a consultant to us dioceses on liturgical matters foot washing does have a long tradition ferrone said and it didnt exclude women up until thats when pope pius xii simplified the holy week rites a reform that included folding the footwashing ritual into the holy thursday mass before marking jesus crucifixion on good friday the problem is that back then catholic women were not allowed into the restricted space near the altar and unlike today they could not have any part in the mass so the rule was that chosen men viri selecti in the latin would have their feet washed by the priest or bishop with that change the footwashing rite also came to be seen as a kind of recreation of the last supper and the institution of the priesthood the tradition was not to have it be a dramatization of what jesus did at the last supper but to be a response to the command to humble service ferrone said modernizing reforms while the second vatican council in the s ushered in numerous reforms including of the liturgy the rule on only washing the feet of men was never addressed but in the s in an effort to reflect the new openness of the church bishops and priests in many dioceses simply ignored the old regulation and began washing the feet of laypeople including women sometimes there were a dozen sometimes more indeed there is a photograph of pope francis when he was cardinal jorge bergoglio of buenos aires argentina washing the feet of women with babies some of whom were breastfeeding today the us conference of catholic bishops acknowledges the letter of the law but stresses that the rite aims to signify both charity and humble service rather than a reenactment of the foundation of the priesthood it drops any reference to washing the feet of people the number of the disciples and notes that it has become customary in many places to invite both men and women to be participants in this rite in recognition of the service that should be given by all the faithful to the church and to the world so in that sense it is a return to a more ancient tradition and very much in line with what pope francis is doing a vatican spokesman fr thomas rosica said tuesday that francis decision to include women and nonbelievers was meant as a gesture to embrace those who were on the fringes of society the official rules he said can sometimes be a distraction from the profound messages of the gospels and of the lord of the church still this is the catholic church and rules are rules even though a vatican spokesman last year said francis decision to wash the feet of women and muslims on holy thursday was absolutely licit because it did not entail a sacrament canon lawyer edward peters said francis set a questionable example by ignoring church law peters a blogger popular with church conservatives and a supporter of the rule said it would be better to change the rule rather than risk undermining the rule of law by flouting it there are of course others who would like to see the current rule maintained and enforced the way morlino does and not just to maintain good order in the church this is being used by those who wish to make a point about holy orders being reserved to men ferrone said the debate over the holy thursday foot washing she said becomes yet another occasion for people who would like to see women excluded from the sanctuary second vatican councilrobert morlinojohn zuhlsdorfrita ferroneholy week printemailpdf show comments ncr comment code

Query:injuries by pets
Page:skip to content drugs amp supplements living healthy find fda consumer updates on the road again fda mobile laboratories sign up to receive webmds awardwinning content delivered to your inbox a sprain is an injury caused by sudden stretching or tearing of the ligaments in and around the joint or the joint capsule itself signs are pain over the joint swelling of the tissues and temporary lamenesstreatment if the dog is unable to put weight on the leg seek veterinary consultation to rule out a fracture or dislocation this is true for any injury that fails to improve in hours xrays should be takenit is most important to prevent further injury by resting the affected part restrict activity by confining the dog in a small area apply cold packs to the injured joint for to minutes three or four times a day for the first hours use a chemical cold pack or put crushed ice in a plastic bag wrap the pack in a towel and secure it in place over the injured joint with a loose gauze wrap an alternative method is to run cold water over the affected leg for to minutes three or four times a dayafter the first hours switch to warm moist compresses for to minutes three times a day for the next two to three days apply as described for cold packs avoid hot compresses which can burn the skinanalgesics may be prescribed by your veterinarian to relieve pain one disadvantage of pain relievers is that they may allow the dog to begin using the leg while the injury is still fresh this can delay healing but if the dogs activity is restricted this is not a problem antiinflammatories may hasten healing by reducing swelling and inflammation around the area keep the dog off the leg by confining him in a small closed area take him out on a leash only to eliminate allow at least three

one of the most commonly seen orthopedic problemsdepending on the severity of the acl injury a dogs symptoms might range from having a hint of lameness to being unable to bear weight on the injured leg a dog with an acl injury may also have swelling on the inside of the kneeone indicator of a torn acl in dogs is the presence of the drawer sign this means that when the veterinarian holds the dogs femur in place the tibia can be pulled forward in a manner similar to a drawer sliding open however the lack of the drawer sign does not mean there is not damage to the aclin addition to a complete physical exam your veterinarian will probably take xrays of your dogs knee to investigate the extent of damage and rule out other possible causes of lameness xrays will allow your veterinarian to determine the presence of fluid or arthritis in the joint and also whether any small pieces of bone broke off with the ligament when it ruptureddogs at risk for torn aclscertain breeds are more prone to dog acl injuries including labrador retrievers poodles bichon frises german shepherds rottweilers and golden retrieversobese animals and those that get occasional strenuous exercise socalled weekend warriors may also be more likely to develop acl injuries often these chronic conditions persist for long periods of time with the dog gradually becoming more lame as the ligament becomes more and more damaged sometimes however a dog will have no obvious symptoms until the ligament finally ruptures often with something as simple as a slight misstepadditionally male dogs neutered at younger than five months old may be more likely to develop acl injuries later in lifestudies have shown that about onethird of the dogs that rupture the acl on one leg will develop the condition in the opposite legtreatment for acl injuries in a dogif left untreated the lameness caused by a partially torn or ruptured acl will improve or go away completely in many dogs especially small ones within three to six weeks regardless the lack of a healthy acl will cause the bones to rub against one another leading to the development of bone spurs pain arthritis and a decreased range of motion these

Query:Organized crime, sports doping, Australia
Page:so if you find a drug and its not on the banned list you will give it a go he said but that entire teams of elite athletes may be systematically using illegal substances to enhance their performance with the knowledge and help of sports scientists coaches and doctors leaves wilkins astounded the sports scientists and sports teams which are potentially doping thats shocking said wilkins but are they going to go down he asks tip of the iceberg all of this comes in the same week that the essendon football club in victoria approached the australian football league afl and australian sports antidoping authority asada to investigate claims that its players took substances that may be illegal shocking though the claim was it may turn out to be the tip of the iceberg in a nation which prides itself on being at the forefront of clean sport the substances the essendon football club believes its players may have used are believed to include peptide or related substances that were injected some peptides are legal for athletes to inject the investigation is expected to focus on whether the illegal substances the club believes its players used was inert peptide or otherwise and whether the drugs were administered as part of a fitness regime usada official armstrong lied to oprah doping club was like a badge of honor journalists crusade to expose armstrong players could face season suspensions though legendary afl coach kevin sheedy said after the acc findings were released that suspension might not be enough we need to get rid of it we need to find the people and eradicate them from the sport he told local reporters though the acc has not named specific athletes or clubs that are under current investigation the national rugby league nrl says more than one of its players and more than one of its clubs are under investigation the code has already committed to an audit and register of people supplying performance services to its players and clubs as well as centralized testing for illicit substances integrity units all sporting codes have expressed shock at the findings as they pledged full cooperation with asada and other investigating authorities the afl the nrl the football federation of australia australian rugby union and cricket australia have agreed to establish integrity units and have called on athletes to own up and cooperate in return for reduced sanctions wilkins said he was surprised that the findings were made public while active investigations are ongoing there are still a lot of qualifiers added wilkins but according to richard ings the former chief of the asada the reports findings are no surprise he said the involvement of criminal networks was well known to the antidoping agency having worked with asada for the past five years it was very clear that there were links between elements of organized crime importing and distributing prohibited substances across australian sport ings told cnn nor was afl chief andrew demetriou surprised by the links between the supply of drugs and organized crime organized crime is very pervasive he told the canberra media conference they find vulnerable players they infiltrate said the afl chief and all of us here today would say that today is the day we draw a line in the sand we address it we tackle it sport is too important in this community organized crime is very pervasive they find vulnerable players they infiltrateandrew demetriou afl chief but demetriou denied that essendon football club went to the authorities with its illicit drug taking suspicions as a result of the acc investigation the accs report draws on past international cases to warn of a potential link between the involvement of crime gangs in sport and matchfixing overseas experience has demonstrated that organized criminal groups involved in matchfixing are increasingly targeting subelite athletes due to the ease with which these individuals can be bought the lower levels of scrutiny from integrity authorities at subelite competitions and the potential longterm value of these athletes to the criminal group it said president of the world antidoping agency john fahey said that its not surprising that the problem has surfaced in australia it is very clear from interpol and we have a close association with them in wada that the suppliers manufacturers traffickers of the performance enhancing drugs are the same people who are connected with the illegal drugs the same people who are connected with matchfixing and illegal gambling so i guess its not surprising that it now surfaces in this country fahey told abc radio sports betting the deputy victorian police commissioner graham ashton said soccer cricket and tennis were most at risk of matchfixing by organized criminals because they attracted big offshore bets the increasing betting pools mean that we need to take preventative action now to make these sports more resilient to this threat he told reporters former south african national rugby union coach jake white now a mentor for the act brumbies thinks it would be difficult to fix a match in rugby the one thing thats magnificent about rugby union is that its such a difficult game to even think about match ixing white told the age newspaper in melbourne in other games when the margins are nilnil results or a team concedes one goal rugby is such a fluid and dynamic game that it would stick out like a sore thumb if you even try to do something thats matchfixing he said an independent senator in the australian parliament nick xenophon wants an immediate suspension of all sports betting until all investigations are complete these extraordinary findings require an urgent response to protect the integrity of sporting codes that millions of australians love senator xenophon said comments raquo share this print email more sharing reddit stumbleupon delicious part of complete coverage on sports spotlight

have an obligation to make sure that we do treat this very seriously and that we respond accordingly graham ashton deputy commissioner of the victoria state police said authorities had identified aleague soccer as being at major risk of match fixing adding that tennis and cricket could also be targets due to the amount of money wagered were seeing vast increases in the betting pools in asia on aleague soccer ashton said when this betting is occurring to that level it becomes attractive for crime figures to want to get involved football federation australia has hired an international agency to assist with surveillance of aleague matches if you want to fix a match we will catch you and as you can see by the investigations that have taken place we are well on the way to seeking out and hunting down those who will dope and cheat there is nothing specific in relation to football but that doesnt mean we dont join in the general concern about the issues that are raised in the acc report said ffa chief executive david gallop a former rugby league administrator the level of deterrence must be high and thats what we are dealing with here both in relation to the doping issue and match fixing sports minister kate lundy said the government would introduce tough new measures to crack down on the use of banned drugs and unethical behaviour in sport if you want to dope and cheat we will catch you lundy said if you want to fix a match we will catch you and as you can see by the investigations that have taken place we are well on the way to seeking out and hunting down those who will dope and cheat the government has strengthened asadas investigative powers resources budget and penalties to tackle the problem the coalition of major professional and participation sports in australia which includes the national governing bodies for sports such as cricket both rugby codes football tennis and australian rules football has agreed to establish integrity units to deal with doping betting and ethical issues and to share information the australian bureau of statistics estimated in that the income generated by the sport and recreation industry in australia topped billion the acc said that figure had since grown significantly while there is a long history of betting on sports the market has expanded significantly in recent years with growth of up to annually the acc report said there has also been a doubling of the number of performance and image enhancing drugs pied seized by australian customs and border protection in recent years with number of pieds detected rising from in to in in the same time theres been a increase in the number of hormones detected despite the gloom and prospect of some highprofile athletes and clubs being tarnished very soon ings

vaccinated as soon as possible the first dose of pertussis vaccine can be given as early as weeks of age older children preadolescents and adults should also be vaccinated against pertussis according to current recommendations its particularly important that people who will be around newborns also be vaccinated added dr chapman this includes babysitters older siblings parents and grandparents when those people are vaccinated they will help protect infants who are too young for immunization the symptoms of pertussis vary by age for children pertussis typically starts with a cough and runny nose that can last up to two weeks the cough then worsens and turns into rapid coughing spells that end with a telltale whooping sound young infants may not have typical pertussis symptoms and may have no

gripped bulgaria was sparked by rising electricity bills but gradually grew into public outrage against government corruption and the influence of organized crime on different levels of society the protests already brought down the countrys centerright government as punishment for its inability to fight poverty and injustice although selfimmolations are not typical for bulgaria experts say they could build an example for possible followers psychologist dimitar gronev warned that they could turn into a social contagion selfimmolation is an act that calls for social response psychologist margarita bakracheva said it is not the result of a personal drama but rather a decision prompted by hopelessness one of the strongest examples of personal rebellion against a dictatorship was the selfimmolation of palach the czech student who set himself on fire in on wenceslas square in central prague to protest the sovietled invasion that crushed the prague spring reforms ndash an act that at the time resonated through much of the communist world inspired by palachs act three other czechs followed his example as well as opponents of the invasion in poland and hungary palach died because he wanted to shout in the loudest way said a document signed by late czech president vaclav havel during communism bulgaria was the most loyal ally of the soviet union all attempts of dissent were

planting japanese flowering cherry trees along the potomac river the effort to bring cherry trees to washington dc preceded the official planting by several decades in eliza ruhamah scidmore returned from her first trip to japan and approached the us army superintendent of the office of public buildings and grounds with the idea of planting cherry trees along the reclaimed waterfront of the potomac river scidmore who would go on to become the first female board member of the national geographic society was rebuffed though she would continue proposing the idea to every superintendent for the next years several cherry trees were brought to the region by individuals in this period including one that was the location of a cherry blossom viewing and tea party hosted by scidmore in northwest dc among the guests was prominent botanist david fairchild and his fiance marian the daughter of inventor alexander graham bell in david fairchild imported cherry trees from the yokohama nursery company in japan and planted them on his own property in chevy chase maryland the fairchilds were pleased with the results of their planting and in began promoting japanese flowering cherry trees as an ideal tree to plant around avenues in the washington area on september with the help of the fairchilds friends the chevy chase land company ordered oriental cherry trees for the chevy chase area in fairchild donated cherry saplings to every dc school to plant on its school grounds in observance of arbor day at an arbor day speech that eliza scidmore attended fairchild proposed that the speedway a now nonexisting route around the dc tidal basin be turned into a field of cherries in scidmore decided to raise the money to buy cherry trees and donate them to the district as a matter largely of form on april she wrote a letter to first lady helen herron taft wife of newly elected president howard taft informing her of her plans two days later the first lady responded thank you very much for your suggestion about the cherry trees i have taken the matter up and am promised the trees but i thought perhaps it would be best to make an avenue of them extending down to the turn in the road as the other part is still too rough to do any planting of course they could not reflect in the water but the effect would be very lovely of the long avenue let me know what you think about this by chance jokichi takamine the japanese chemist who discovered adrenaline was in washington with mr midzuno the japanese consul to new york city on april informed of a plan to plant japanese cherry trees along the speedway takamine asked if mrs taft would accept an additional trees while midzuno suggested that the trees be given in the name of tokyo takamine and midzuo subsequently met with the first lady who accepted the offer of trees photographers and painters along the tidal basin under blossoming cherry trees in a ceremony on march first lady helen herron taft and viscountess chinda wife of the japanese ambassador planted the first two of these trees on the north bank of the tidal basin in west potomac park at the end of the ceremony the first lady presented viscountess

with this order aaron and christine boring a pittsburgh couple sued google for invasion of privacy street view made a photo of their home available online and they claimed that this diminished the

one canadian city in march gave rise to a different complaint les macpherson a columnist with the saskatoon starphoenix complained in a march column that the timing of the imaging at the end of a protracted winter season and before the true onset of spring would cast an unfavourable image of saskatoon and other cities what worries me more than any loss of privacy is the prospect of presenting to the world a highly unflattering impression of canadian cities with the possible exception of victoria they do not show off well in the spring google could not have picked a more inauspicious time to do its scanning saskatoon is unfortunately typical for google to record its images of the city at this most visually unappealing time of year is like photographing a beautiful woman who has just awakened from a sixmonth coma he wrote in early october the first canadian cities began to appear on street view several including saskatoon were not included in the initial rollout one city that was

however pictures taken before this decision mostly in may have remained available online but google was obliged to erase every picture from that period should they be disputed in may the ban was lifted after the google lowered the cameras by centimeters european unionedit a recent demand from the european union would require google to warn local residents before sending out the cameras it also requires google to keep the not blurred versions of the photos no longer than months instead of a year google was instructed to give advance notice online and in the local press before

widespread critical acclaim review aggregator rotten tomatoes reports that of critics have given the season a positive review the sites consensus is the passage of time has done little to dull mad mens rich cast of characters who continue to confound on metacritic the sixth season has scored an out of based on reviews indicating universal acclaim david hinckley of new york daily news had high praise for the shows longevity claiming that while many shows that have reached this point in the road have left their creative peak behind mad men shows no such erosion it still has things it wants to say and it still has the poetry to say them well with regard to the seasons first episode tim goodman of the hollywood reporter stated whats intriguing and partly amazing about the two hour movie called the doorway that opens the season april is that weiner has not lost his touch at writing a beautifully crafted scriptjammed with the sadness and humor and personal revelations weve all come to appreciate but in addition to that hes decided to really hit home mad mens key theme in the first two hours with a kind of ferocity of intent weve rarely seen from him jeff jensen of entertainment weekly had a decidedly more mixed reaction stating like bettys frumpy frocks mad men supersize episodes arent flattering weiner should stick with tighter denser storytelling packages i hope he also delivers the season of change that the premiere seems to promise matt zoller seitz of vulture says that its a clever at times tricky season opener in lostlike style it strategically withholds key information that would help us make immediate sense of dons behavior which by turns suggests a prisoner a sleepwalker and a ghost jace lacob of the daily beast stated that weiner is both archeologist and astronaut and season of mad men is no exception a beautifully realized and dazzling recreation of our collective past and a glimpse of the infinite and unknowable alan sepinwall of hitfix said it continues to be one of the most satisfying dramas in the history of the medium david wiegland of the san francisco chronicle said that don drapers journey has been and remains maddening in a very good way as far as what makes a great tv show and that like a great novel mad men has character depths yet to plumb in a rave review maureen ryan of the huffington post stated that the amc drama is full of sharp writing ambiguous segues effective surprises and the usual array of pitchperfect performances accoladesedit for the th primetime emmy awards the sixth season received nominations including for

to england and scotland the measure permits samesex couples to convert their civil partnerships to traditional marriages and grants married transgender citizens legal recognition without altering their marriage certificate for the global lgbt community the uks progressive stance is a step toward fairness however all residents of the uk arent as thrilled at this prospect the bill passed on a vote which confirms a widespread report of a split within prime minister david camerons conservative party over the issue the church of england is also opposed to the legislation which gives religious bodies an option to decline to perform samesex ceremonies but above the uks internal rumblings about the legislation is the fact that the nation is advancing rights for samesex couples while the united states is still in tumult though america is considered a global superpower our lagging of social progress in civil rights has longbeen an issue that must be addressed in mary l dudziaks cold war civil rights race and the image of american democracy she recounts american politics in the dawn of the cold war and our pursuit of superpower status one of the issues that couldve prevented america from conquering communism was racial segregation and violence toward minorities the worlds newspapers used columns to react to these atrocities which forced the united states to begin passing civil rights legislation history will repeat itself if america does not see the value in extending the rights of marriage to all as more countries including argentina belgium canada spain south africa

nine other states have legalized it but according to the pew research center states have banned samesex marriage or limited it to heterosexual couples despite our triumphs on civil rights there is

cardinala tale of two speeches the queens imaginary world war iii address and the evil empire speech which showed why it was a futile exercise john mason said that the bill needed more safeguards for religious freedom pa the scottish parliament has passed a bill that will allow samesex marriages to be performed later this year but religious organisations have the right not to perform them members of the scottish parliament supported the legislation by at the end of a debate on tuesday and applauded when the result was announced lawmakers had rejected pleas from the catholic church to oppose the marriage and civil partnership scotland bill and also resisted attempts to amend it the bill will be sent to queen elizabeth ii for the formality of royal assent before it will become law with the first samesex marriages expected in scotland at the earliest at the end of july the catholic bishops conference of scotland said in a statement yesterday emailed to catholic news service that the bishops were disappointed by the outcome of the vote it does not change the church s understanding of our commitment to the sacrament of marriage the statement added the bill offers some protection to the churches by not compelling religious organizations to perform marriage ceremonies for samesex couples but instead allows them to opt in to the legislation clerics whose religious organization have not opted into the law will not be able to perform samesex wedding ceremonies during the debate alex neil secretary for health and wellbeing said the scottish assembly had got the balance right in the bill we are extending the rights and freedoms of people of the same sex who wish to be married and to have that marriage recognized by the state he said at the same time we are building in necessary safeguards for the rights of those who are opposed to samesex marriage and who do not wish to perform samesex marriage particularly church organizations and celebrants we are doing a remarkable thing today he added we are saying to the world loud and clear on behalf of scotland that we believe in recognizing love between samesex couples in the same way that we do between oppositesex couples however john mason scottish national party representative from glasgow said he was fearful that anyone opposed to samesex marriage would be victimized if the bill went through without more robust protections he unsuccessfully proposed an amendment asking for recognition that belief in marriage as a voluntary union between one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others for life is a belief worthy of respect in a democratic society it is an integral tenet of faith for many christians muslims and others as well as the belief of many of no faith position at all he said initially scottish bishops were extremely vocal about samesex marriage at one point cardinal keith o brien then archbishop of st andrews and edinburgh described samesex marriage as a grotesque subversion of a universally accepted human right that would shame britain in the eyes of the world after the cardinal resigned in february when he said his sexual conduct has fallen beneath the standards expected of me the scottish bishops made their views clear through formal channels such as presentations to government committees rather than through the media bishop hugh gilbert of aberdeen wrote on january to members of the scottish parliament whose constituencies fall within his diocese to ask them to amend the legislation if they could not prevent the bill becoming law he said he had major concerns over the category mistake of trying to redefine marriage and about the adequacy of proposed safeguards for groups and people who held to the traditional understanding of marriage there is a widespread attitude that accuses those unsympathetic to the proposed legislation of bigotry or homophobia he said this is seriously unjust and a very real concern it is an irony that a measure aimed at preventing a perceived injustice to a small minority threatens to provoke fresh injustices to a far larger percentage of the population the bishop said he asked lawmakers to try to protect churches against possible litigation and threats to their charitable status he also said parents needed to be protected from attempts to stop them from passing on their understanding of marriage to children most notably in faith schools bishop gilbert said he also feared that christians and others might suffer discrimination in their career or workplace face restrictions on freedom of speech be denied access to public services or be prevented from fostering or adopting children sometimes we are assured that these freedoms are already sufficiently guaranteed by law but others question this he said the general climate is not reassuring it would therefore be a real reassurance for those dismayed by this proposed legislation to have their concerns met within the legislation itself samesex marriage

couples demonstrates our societys respect for all individuals regardless of their sexuality it demonstrates the importance we attach to being able to live freely it says so much about the society that we are and the society that we want to live in this is a historic moment that will resonate in many peoples lives i am proud that we have made it happen and i look forward to the first same sex wedding by next summer view a fullsize version of this graphic on flickr first same sex weddings by summer work is now underway across government to ensure that all the necessary arrangements are in place to allow marriages of same sex couples to take place a quickly as possible once the necessary processes are in place it is anticipated that the first wedding could happen by summer the arrangements for allowing the conversion of civil partnerships to marriages and allowing people who change their legal gender to remain in their marriages will follow later as these will take longer

Query:Higgs Boson discovery
Page:diagram showing the higgs boson and top quark masses which could indicate whether our universe is stable or a longlived bubble as of the ellipse based on tevatron and lhc data still allows for both possibilities for decades scientific models of our universe have included the possibility that it exists as a longlived but not completely stable sector of space which could potentially at some time be destroyed upon toppling into a more stable vacuum state if the masses of the higgs boson and top quark are known more exactly and the standard model provides a correct description of particle physics up to extreme energies of the planck scale then it is possible to calculate whether the universes present vacuum state is stable or merely longlived this was sometimes misreported as the higgs boson ending the universe a gev higgs mass seems to be extremely close to the boundary for stability estimated in as gev but a definitive answer requires much more precise measurements of the top quarks pole mass if measurements of the higgs boson suggest that our universe lies within a false vacuum of this kind then it would imply more than likely in many billions of years note that the universes forces particles and structures could cease to exist as we know them and be replaced by different ones if a true vacuum happened to nucleate note it also suggests that the higgs selfcoupling and its function could be very close to zero at the planck scale with intriguing implications including theories of gravity and higgsbased inflation a future electronpositron collider would be able to provide the precise measurements of the top quark needed for such calculations insight into the energy of the vacuum more speculatively the higgs field has also been proposed as the energy of the vacuum which at the extreme energies of the first moments of the big bang caused the universe to be a kind of featureless symmetry of undifferentiated extremely high energy in this kind of speculation the single unified field of a grand unified theory is identified as or modeled upon the higgs field and it is through successive symmetry breakings of the higgs field or some similar field at phase transitions that the present universes known forces and fields arise link to the cosmological constant problem the relationship if any between the higgs field and the presently observed vacuum energy density of the universe has also come under scientific study as observed the present vacuum energy density is extremely close to zero but the energy density expected from the higgs field supersymmetry and other current theories are typically many orders of magnitude larger it is unclear how these should be reconciled this cosmological constant problem remains a further major unanswered problem in physics the six authors of the prl papers who received the j j sakurai prize for their work from left to right kibble guralnik hagen englert brout right higgs the three papers written in were each recognised as milestone papers during physical review letterss th anniversary celebration their six authors were also awarded the j j sakurai prize for theoretical particle physics for this work a controversy also arose the same year because in the event of a nobel prize only up to three scientists could be recognised with six being credited for the papers two of the three prl papers by higgs and by ghk contained equations for the hypothetical field that eventually would become known as the higgs field and its hypothetical quantum the higgs boson higgs subsequent paper showed the decay mechanism of the boson only a massive boson can decay and the decays can prove the mechanismcitation needed in the paper by higgs the boson is massive and in a closing sentence higgs writes that an essential feature of the theory is the prediction of incomplete multiplets of scalar and vector bosons frank close comments that s gauge theorists were focused on the problem of massless vector bosons and the implied existence of a massive scalar boson was not seen as important only higgs directly addressed it in the paper by ghk the boson is massless and decoupled from the massive states in reviews dated and guralnik states that in the ghk model the boson is massless only in a lowestorder approximation but it is not subject to any constraint and acquires mass at higher orders and adds that the ghk paper was the only one to show that there are no massless goldstone bosons in the model and to give a complete analysis of the general higgs mechanism all three reached similar conclusions despite their very different approaches higgs paper essentially used classical techniques englert and brouts involved calculating vacuum polarization in perturbation theory around an assumed symmetrybreaking vacuum state and ghk used operator formalism and conservation laws to explore in depth the ways in which goldstones theorem may be worked around in addition to explaining how mass is acquired by vector bosons the higgs mechanism also predicts the ratio between the w boson and z boson masses as well as their couplings with each other and with the standard model quarks and leptonscitation needed subsequently many of these predictions have been verified by precise measurements performed at the lep and the slc colliders thus overwhelmingly confirming that some kind of higgs mechanism does take place in nature but the exact manner by which it happens has not yet been discoveredcitation needed the results of searching for the higgs boson are expected to provide evidence about how this is realized in naturecitation needed theoretical propertiesedit symmetry breaking illustrated at high energy levels left the ball settles in the center and the result is symmetrical at lower energy levels right the overall rules remain symmetrical but the mexican hat potential comes into effect local symmetry inevitably becomes broken since eventually the ball must at random roll one way or another gauge invariance is an important property of modern particle theories such as the standard model partly due to its success in other areas of fundamental physics such as electromagnetism and the strong interaction quantum chromodynamics however there were great difficulties in developing gauge theories for the weak nuclear force or a possible unified electroweak interaction fermions with a mass term would violate gauge symmetry and therefore cannot be gauge invariant this can be seen by examining the dirac lagrangian for a fermion in terms of left and right handed components we find none of the spinhalf particles could ever flip helicity as required for mass so they must be masslessnote w and z bosons are observed to have mass but a boson mass term contains terms which clearly depend on the choice of gauge and therefore these masses too cannot be gauge invariant therefore it seems that none of the standard model fermions or bosons could begin with mass as an inbuilt property except by abandoning gauge invariance if gauge invariance were to be retained then these particles had to be acquiring their mass by some other mechanism or interaction additionally whatever was giving these particles their mass had to not break gauge invariance as the basis for other parts of the theories where it worked well and had to not require or predict unexpected massless particles and longrange forces seemingly an inevitable consequence of goldstones theorem which did not actually seem to exist in nature a solution to all of these overlapping problems came from the discovery of a previously unnoticed borderline case hidden in the mathematics of goldstones theoremnote that under certain conditions it might theoretically be possible for a symmetry to be broken without disrupting gauge invariance and without any new massless particles or forces and having sensible renormalisable results mathematically this became known as the higgs mechanism the standard model hypothesizes a field which is responsible for this effect called the higgs field symbol which has the unusual property of a nonzero amplitude in its ground state ie a nonzero vacuum expectation value it can have this effect because of its unusual mexican hat shaped potential whose lowest point is not at its centre below a certain extremely high energy level the existence of this nonzero vacuum expectation spontaneously breaks electroweak gauge symmetry which in turn gives rise to the higgs mechanism and triggers the acquisition of mass by those particles interacting with the field this effect occurs because scalar field components of the higgs field are absorbed by the massive bosons as degrees of freedom and couple to the fermions via yukawa coupling thereby producing the expected mass terms in effect when symmetry breaks under these conditions the goldstone bosons that arise interact with the higgs field and with other particles capable of interacting with the higgs field instead of becoming new massless particles the intractable problems of both underlying theories neutralise each other and the residual outcome is that elementary particles acquire a consistent mass based on how strongly they interact with the higgs field it is the simplest known process capable of giving mass to the gauge bosons while remaining compatible with gauge theories its quantum would be a scalar boson known as the higgs boson the standard model prediction for the decay width of the higgs particle depends on the value of its mass quantum mechanics predicts that if it is possible for a particle to decay into a set of lighter particles then it will eventually do so this is also true for the higgs boson the likelihood with which this happens depends on a variety of factors including the difference in mass the strength of the interactions etc most of these factors are fixed by the standard model except for the mass of the higgs boson itself for a higgs boson with a mass of gevc the sm predicts a mean life time of about snote the minimal standard model as described above is the simplest known model for the higgs mechanism with just one higgs field however an extended higgs sector with additional higgs particle doublets or triplets is also possible and many extensions of the standard model have this feature the nonminimal higgs sector favoured by theory are the twohiggsdoublet models hdm which predict the existence of a quintet of scalar particles two cpeven neutral higgs bosons h and h a cpodd neutral higgs boson a and two charged higgs particles h supersymmetry susy also predicts relations between the higgsboson masses and the masses of the gauge bosons and could accommodate a gevc neutral higgs boson the key method to distinguish between these different models involves study of the particles interactions coupling and exact decay processes branching ratios which can be measured and tested experimentally in particle collisions in the typei hdm model one higgs doublet couples to up and down quarks while the second doublet does not couple to quarks this model has two interesting limits in which the lightest higgs couples to just fermions gaugephobic or just gauge bosons fermiophobic but not both in the typeii hdm model one higgs doublet only couples to uptype quarks the other only couples to downtype quarks the heavily researched minimal supersymmetric standard model mssm includes a typeii hdm higgs sector so it could be disproven by evidence of a typei hdm higgscitation needed in other models the higgs scalar is a composite particle for example in technicolor the role of the higgs field is played by strongly bound pairs of fermions called techniquarks other models feature pairs of top quarks see top quark condensate in yet other models there is no higgs field at all and the electroweak symmetry is broken using extra dimensions the standard model leaves the mass of the higgs boson as a parameter to be measured rather than a value to be calculated this is seen as theoretically unsatisfactory particularly as quantum corrections related to interactions with virtual particles should apparently cause the higgs particle to have a mass immensely higher than that observed but at the same time the standard model requires a mass of the order of to gev to ensure unitarity in this case to unitarise longitudinal vector boson scattering reconciling these points appears to require explaining why there is an almostperfect cancellation resulting in the visible mass of gev and it is not clear how to do this because the weak force is about times stronger than gravity and linked to this the higgs bosons mass is so much less than the planck mass or the grand unification energy it appears that either there is some underlying connection or reason for these observations which is unknown and not described by the standard model or some unexplained and extremely precise finetuning of parameters however at present neither of these explanations is proven this is known as a hierarchy problem more broadly the hierarchy problem amounts to the worry that a future theory of fundamental particles and interactions should not have excessive finetunings or unduly delicate cancellations and should allow masses of particles such as the higgs boson to be calculable the problem is in some ways unique to spin particles such as the higgs boson which can give rise to issues related to quantum corrections that do not affect particles with spin a number of solutions have been proposed including supersymmetry conformal solutions and solutions via extra dimensions such as braneworld models experimental searchedit lederman whimsically asks whether the higgs boson was added just to perplex and confound those seeking knowledge of the universe and whether physicists will be confounded by it as recounted in that story or ultimately surmount the challenge and understand how beautiful is the universe god has made other proposalsedit a renaming competition by british newspaper the guardian in resulted in their science correspondent choosing the name the champagne bottle boson as the best submission the bottom of a champagne bottle is in the shape of the higgs potential and is often used as an illustration in physics lectures so its not an embarrassingly grandiose name it is memorable and it has some physics connection too the name higgson was suggested as well in an opinion piece in the institute of physics online publication physicsworldcom media explanations and analogiesedit there has been considerable public discussion of analogies and explanations for the higgs particle and how the field creates mass including coverage of explanatory attempts in their own right and a competition in for the best popular explanation by thenuk minister for science sir william waldegrave and articles in newspapers worldwide in the standard model the higgs field is a fourcomponent

cerns large hadron collider which cost billion to build and run in a mile kilometer tunnel beneath the swissfrench border ndash to produce the extreme surge of energies simulating those trillionth to trillionths of a second after the big bang the higgs boson is so elusive that only about one collision per trillion will produce one of them in the collider cern said it is open question whether this is the higgs boson that was expected in the original formulation or the lightest of several higgses predicted in some theories that go beyond that model we found a new particle and we want to know how it behaves and maybe it behaves the way it was predicted in maybe its a little bit different said physicist sean carroll of the california institute of technology who isnt involved in the research finding a higgs more or less as expected is actually a bit deflating carroll said because physicists had also hoped that an unexpected type of higgs might open windows into yet more mysteries of the universe scientists always want to be wrong in their theories they always want to be surprised he said its a bittersweet victory when your theory turns out to be right because it means on the one hand youre right thats nice but on the other hand you havent learned anything new thats surprising some of the remaining mysteries including why gravity is so weak and what is the dark matter that is

state majgen muhammadu buhari rtd yesterday rejected the body s offer to him to be one of its mediators in its proposed dialogue with the federal government this came yesterday as gunmen suspected to be boko haram s members killed two chinese nationals in borno state the lagos league of political parties llpp had on tuesday asked president goodluck jonathan and the federal government not to treat lightly a protest letter from the chinese government urging substantial measures to protect chinese personnel and institutions in nigeria in a statement by its chairman chief udoka udeogaranya llpp said it considered china as a friendly nation with nigeria and a major trading partner and therefore required special measures to protect the rights property and lives of the nationals in nigeria boko haram which last week offered to cease fire and requested among other things a dialogue with the federal government in saudi arabia named buhari the leader of the opposition congress for progressives change cpc and its presidential candidate in the general election and alhaji ali mongonu as their mediators the leadership of the cpc had earlier urged buhari to reject the group s offer to mediate on their behalf insisting that accepting the offer would mean going contrary to the belief of the party which the national chairman tony momoh says does not believe the principle of destruction in the name of religion which the group is noted for buhari who spoke at the end of the cpc s board of trustees meeting yesterday in abuja noted that his party had already expressed its position over the boko haram s request adding that he could not accept to mediate on behalf of an organisation he did not know anything about the former head of state who disclosed that his party had officially endorsed the proposed merger plan with the action congress of nigeria acn and other progressive parties faulted the federal government s handling of the boko haram s case he noted that the principles of the group did not tally with the ideology of his political party adding that the cpc had never believed in the wanton destruction of life and property which he accused the group of propagating well i think my party has done an excellent job on that unless some people do not want to believe i do not know any member of boko haram secondly i do not believe in their cause ordinarily if there was a stage where i mentioned anything about the sect that was when i said that there are three different groups of boko haram one that was led by mohammadu yusuf whom we knew very well in the military he was a very fine soldier we all knew of they arrested him and handed him over to the police a healthy and hearty young man and they killed him again his inlaw was murdered and their houses were razed and the borno state government compensated them these things we criticised the second boko haram was a criminal who used to blow up banks and thieve money and issue statements as boko haram then i said that the biggest boko haram is the federal government itself this is because it has all the power to stop those killings this has led a section of the country to be paralysed so how can i represent people i do not know i do not believe in whatever they are seeking i cannot work for either the boko haram or government i do not believe in what they are doing in destruction of life and property and the government does not want to intervene to stop all that with all the military and security the federal government could not stop that why should the federal government occupy some areas of the country and victimise citizens in the name of fighting boko haram this type of thing happened in britain during the era of margaret thatcher as prime minister when an armed group resorted to killing and destruction but the british government did not go and occupy those areas and inflict more injury on its people they handled that situation carefully using the military and other security operatives unlike what is happening currently in nigeria to me the federal government has lost absolute control of the country s security he added we are optimists in the merger plan and the majority of nigerians believe in the coming together of the opposition parties if the ruling party must be flushed out in also the joy of multiparty democracy is the coming together of all the opposition parties to challenge the ruling party and i challenge the nigerian elite to go and do some research from to date and find out what the federal government under the pdp has received in money and how they have utilised the excesses that have come to the country with the coming together of the opposition we are going to disappoint them gunmen in an unmarked golf volkswagen vehicle shot and killed two chinese nationals at a road project in benishiekh town of borno state and snatched their sports utility vehicle suv at about am yesterday benisheikh is kilometres west of maiduguri the borno state capital and an epicentre of boko haram according to an eyewitness and resident of benishiekh yinus abubakar the gunmen came in two golf volkswagen vehicles in the morning and ambushed the chinese engineers working on the damaturumaiduguri dual carriageway and bridge he said we were shocked and terrified with the gunmen s attacks and killings as we had to run into our houses when we started hearing several gunshots on the damaturu road for minutes they gunmen fled towards damaturu with the snatched vehicle of the engineers on whether there are other casualties of the attacks and killings abubakar said no other person was killed their target was to kill the chinese engineers and snatch their vehicle and fled in the same vehicle they came in confirming the incident yesterday in a telephone interview in maiduguri the borno state police commissioner yuguda abdullahi said that he heard of the benishiekh attacks and killingssource the guardian th november i don t know any boko haram member buhari from olusola fabiyi abuja six days after the fundamentalist islamic sect boko haram set conditions for ceasefire president goodluck jonathan on tuesday described its members and sponsors as uncivilised terminating innocent lives through terrorist acts is primitive so perpetrators and sponsors of terrorism through boko haram cannot be anything but uncivilised jonathan said he spoke in dutse jigawa state as he ended his twoday visit to the state stressing that it was wrong for any individual or group to resort to killing to express grievances the president said boko haram s activities were inhibiting national development jonathan therefore admonished all nigerians to speak out in condemnation of terrorist acts in the country boko haram has since attacked military and police facilities worship centres and drinking joints among others no fewer than people have been killed in attacks by the sect members last thursday abu mohammed ibn abdulaziz who is believed to be the secondincommand to the leader of the sect said they were willing to negotiate provided the government met their conditions some of the terms are that the negotiation must hold in saudi arabia that a former head of state majgen muhammadu buhari must lead other negotiatorsand payment of compensation to members of the sect killed unjustly before the president s outburst there had been indications that the government was already considering paying the compensation demanded and that it had began preparing for the talk with the sect a very dependable source in the presidency had on sunday said i can confirm to you that it is true that the group is currently talking with the government the good news is that they are talking and they have promised to cease fire once some of their demands are met for conditions that are not difficult to meet such as the demand for diyya for their identified members that were killed the government may meet such demands government can also give critical thought to those found to be innocent but are being detained or prosecuted particularly women and children as demanded by the group since they do not have any objection to the trial of those genuinely involved in crime however the christian association of nigeria on tuesday opposed payment of compensation to members of the sect can said it would also demand compensation should the federal government compensate members of boko haram the umbrella body for christians in the country also berated the amnesty international over its report on human rights abuses against the violent sect it said that the ai had not been commenting on the killings and maiming of christians by boko haram can secretarygeneral dr musa asake said paying compensation to boko haram members would be an insult to christians asake said these are the people that are killing us and they are looking for compensation the federal government should not even listen to that because the fact that we christians are keeping quiet does not mean that we are dumb we are looking for peace and we want peace but when they begin to talk of compensation the question is compensation for what after they have killed people made many children orphans and destroyed our churches and they are asking for compensation he said that the association would demand compensation for churches destroyed and members killed by boko haram the can secretary stated when you begin to talk of compensation how can you compensate somebody who has been the breadwinner of an entire family and he is killed how much will you give to keep that family going if that is the dimension that boko haram wants we are ready if government pays them compensation then we too will demand compensation for our people that have been killed he also reiterated can s opposition to the sect s choice of buhari as a mediator between it and the government he said that can would not accept saudi arabia as the venue for any peace meeting why saudi arabia why buhari why these people that they are mentioning we are very interested they did not mention any christian they are killing us and they want muslims to go and decide it to decide what he asked berating the ai asake said that the human rights group should disclose its source of information he said i read what the human rights people said but i wish they could tell me their source all these killings have been going on where were the human rights people they are just showing up now to say there is abuse and rape without telling us the source if i get the source and validate it then i can comment what have they said about the christians that are being killed is that not human rights abuse how did they know what has happened this thing is taking a different dimension and where are they getting their information who is feeding them with that information i have not read where the human rights people are condemning what boko haram is doing to christians but a traditional leader and saridauna samaru in the zazau emirate council zaria in kaduna state alhaji mohammed bello sa id supported payment of compensation to boko haram he said if compensating the families of the killed members of the sect would ensure peace and stability in the country then the federal government should do so we are interested in what will bring peace to the country and if compensating boko haram family memberswill bring peace so be it he said source punch th november cpc rejects buhari s nomination by boko haram byjohn ofikhenua vincent ikuomola abuja and jide orintunsin minna more dust is

primitive dr jonathan who spoke in dutse jigawa state noted that taking people s lives especially innocent ones through terrorism is itself primitive hence perpetrators and sponsors of the sect are uncivilised he urged nigerians to totally condemn terrorism killings by the group are unjustifiable besides the president said nigerians should assist the authorities to check the trend which he described as inimical to development the president praised the people of jigawa state for maintaining peace despite the violence within the northeast geopolitical zone niger state governor babangida

proposed negotiations national chairman tony momoh gave the advice in abuja in an interview with the news agency of nigeria nan gen buhari contested the election on the party s ticket there is no need for any other person to attend a meeting between the federal government and boko haram for whatever grievances they say they have we in the cpc do not see where buhari comes in we are concerned by the way the name of gen buhari is being dragged into this affair momoh said adding another thing is that nobody reached out to gen buhari to say they have been nominated or is being nominated along with others to mediate or be witnesses to discussion between boko haram and the federal government momoh said buhari had not told anybody or the party that he was interested in the nomination besides he said the cpc would not associate with issues that involved criminality he said what was important was for the government to maintain true democracy by providing adequate security and welfare to the citizens we believe in one country which must remain together and move together in the direction of peace justice and fair play momoh said according to him the abuse of the democratic system is the result of some challenges confronting the country any abuse of this democracy is unjust he said adding we have chosen a twolegged approach democracy and social justice and we want to achieve social justice by using a system of government called democracy all hands must be on deck to tackle corruption he said the archbishop metropolitan primate church of nigeria anglican communion the most revd okoh described the boko haram sect as a faceless mafia speaking at the second edition of the divine commonwealth conference in abuja rev okoh said the christian faith is something which must be defended every christian is a defender of this faith every christian of every generation must defend it it is the duty of every generation to pass it on uncorrupted and unperverted he said adding there is scarcely a common understanding of how to begin to approach the advance of violent islam some canvass fireforfire approach others believe that good christians must continue praying and even try to preach to the muslims to change them meanwhile the killing and muslim advance continue unchecked in between the two extremes are those who believe in dialogue and seminars unfortunately boko haram is a faceless mafia which makes this proposition merely academic and noneffectual according to the archbishop boko haram has stated that it wants to weed christianity out of northern nigeria while executing its mission the sect said okoh has been bombing shooting slaughtering and maiming christians he added that due to the violence many christians have become intimidated and relocated to other places he lamented that our dioceses in maiduguri damaturu kano bauchi yola zaria jos among other are now drastically depopulated the onslaught against the christian faith said okoh transcends nigeria as violent religious extremists such as the ones in nigeria are now spreading to other african countries as kenya uganda and tanzania he recalled that in dare es salaam tanzania seven churches were burnt by muslims on the excuse that a boy urinated near a mosque according to rev okoh kenya and uganda churches have at various times been attacked by the extremist alshabaab islamic group very active in east africa the archbishop also noted that kenya is executing a full military campaign against this sect rev okoh said the situation in the sudan is complex and complicated the islam of sudan is a fundamentalist brand and there is a high traffic between that country nigeria kenya and other neighbouring countries in addition to all this there is the fluid situation in egypt under the muslim brotherhood as well as the boiling situation in libya again nigeria is exposed apart from all this the twareg rebels in north mali have added to the threatening situation against christianity

government to avoid going into dialogue with the wrong boko haram members aliyu who made this known in minna stated that though the forum was in support of any move that would bring lasting peace to the region it would be wrong for the federal government to go into dialogue with fake members of the sect the governor who spoke when he received the road map for peace unity and development of northern nigeria prepared by the arewa consultative forum said we should know who we are talking to we should not allow people to hijack the process we should confirm who we are dealing with we should talk to them but we should talk only to genuine people he urged the political leadership of the north to fight poverty and put in place a massive plan for employment especially in the north eastern part of the country as one of the ways to solve the security problem in the region aliyu also spoke against the high level of corruption in public and private sector saying that it is a cankerworm that has eaten deep into the body fabric of the country insisting that we must punish the guilty we must deter those who want to engage in corrupt practices he also admonished the independent national electoral commission inec to work according to the rules setting up the organisation by delisting some political parties that did not perform up to the required standard in the last election according to the governor it was wrong for political parties to exist only to endorse candidates for election without presenting candidates for such contests source this day th november boko haram ceasefire plot to kill more igbo returnees ndigbo in no hurry to return to north uwazuruike returnees recall horror tales i saw family of four wiped out i saw a pregnant woman disemboweled her baby s head cut off i ll never go back to the north from emmanuel uzor onitsha indications emerged at the weekend that the federal government is not enthused and may therefore not accept the peace proposal presented by the dreaded ahlan sunnah lid da waati wal jihad yaanaa brothers popularly known as the boko haram sect sunday vanguard can reveal the single most important pointer to this can be traced to the experience of former president umaru musa yar adua president goodluck jonathan s late boss who had attempted to strike a deal with the then fledgling sect by releasing some of its members upon the release the sect members regrouped and relaunched its offensive while mobilizing and swelling its ranks a dependable intelligence source said at the weekend that that experience is still very fresh in the consciousness of those who were privy to that arrangement when the late president was alive and would therefore not want to repeat the same thing one of the conditions precedent for the peace talks proposed by boko haram is that its members in the custody of the federal government should be released what guarantees can we get that once these people are released as a sign of good faith they would not go and regroup and launch fresh offensive against the government this was what happened between and when former president yar adua tried to broker a peace deal which was kickstarted by the release of some members of the sect the apprehension of government independent investigations carried out by sunday vanguard suggest has to do with the belief in government circles that the leadership of boko haram may not be in total control of some of the members this belief is strengthened by the plethora of criminal activities being carried out in parts of northern nigeria and which are attributed to the sect but which the sect s leadership deny from time to time the reasoning in government it was discovered is that any form of talks opened between it and boko haram may not yield the desired result as there are now established splinter groups that sometimes operate independent of the sect s high command in fact according to a source close to the operations of the sect some of the members of the group who are sometimes expected to return the arms that have been used for an operation or operations sometimes do not it is a few of these guys who give a bad name to the group and that is why sometimes the group s high command comes out to deny some criminal acts attributed to it yet information filtered out yesterday that some of the proposed persons by the sect may not be trusted by government abu mohammed ibn abdulaziz the secondincommand to boko haram s leader abubakar shekau presented the conditions on thursday during a radio conference with journalists in maiduguri the secondincommand named former military head of state and presidential candidate of the congress for progressive change cpc general muhammadu buhari dr shettima monguno a former yobe state governor

be abdulaziz abu abbas sheikh ibrahim yusuf sheikh sani kontogora and mamman nur as for the former head of state buhari his decision not to have anything to do with the jonathan administration may not grant him disposition to mediate sunday vanguard was made to understand that one of the persons proposed for the talks may have links with alqaeda in the islamic magreb aqim and therefore may not be trusted as a mediator a few others are viewed by the intelligence community as not being capable of coming clean because of past frightful experiences in the hands of the sect members but again fuelling the indication that the proposal may have been killed on arrival were the murder of general muhammed shuwa rtd and another deadly attack by men suspected to be members of the sect in maiduguri at the weekend the attack on damboa town some kilometers from maiduguri left four dead the council secretariat complex houses and a fire station petrolbombed with improvised explosive devices ieds also playing out significantly in the consciousness of those in government while not wanting to be seen as not prepared for peace talks is the caliber and sensibilities of the names proposed by the sect as mediators already the christian association of nigeria can has objected to the inclusion of buhari killed as boko haram fire rages those killed in the friday evening attack in the borno town were identified as a fire officer hassan maina who was shot when the assailants attacked his office a staffer of borno state high court maiduguri mallam ndajara ndahi said to be

damboa council secretariat complex and housing estate and threw explosives and petrolbomb at the buildings the security guards at the buildings he said fled but two of them who stayed back to put out the fire ignited by the bombing were shot in the legs and chests the both died at the entrance of the secretariat complex usman in a telephone chat yesterday told our correspondent that the gunmen came through maiduguri road at about pm on friday and fired gunshots to scare people at the damboa market we had to run for our lives as the shops and market stalls were hurriedly shut the men of the

station housing units of the council and secretariat complex gideon said as soon as the police area commander of damboa sends in his report to the police headquarters the media will be briefed adding

boko haram in the proposed negotiation with government describing it as an eye opener in the entire debacle can secretary in charge of the states dr joseph ajujungwa in a statement said it left to nigerians to judge what had been happening regarding the issue of boko haram which had killed hundreds of nigerians the statement said may i use this opportunity to ask why general buhari as the secretary of can in the southern states the truth will one day be made manifest general buhari as i read in the newspapers had said that if he was not declared president of the federal republic of nigeria in he will make nigeria ungovernable for dr goodluck jonathan other people also said so since then nigeria has not known peace all the people that said similar thing are moving about freely and today one of them is going to moderate the peace talk the blood of those killed by boko haram sect is speaking and god is not happy as we condemn the unprovoked attacks on innocent citizens of

general secretary of national democratic coalition nadeco on friday urged the federal government not to allow the boko haram group to dictate the pace of peace talks he gave the advice in lagos during the th annual leadership lecture and role model awards organised by leadership watch a nongovernmental organisation opadokun said that the demand by boko haram for peace talks in saudi arabia among other demands is a curious demand and an attempt by the tail to wag the head the nadeco scribe said that it was a total absurdity for a violent group which had caused a lot of mayhem in the country to dictate to nigerians urging the federal government to live up to expectations opadokun who was the chairman of the occasion said that even though he did not disapprove of dialogue with the group such talks should be held on the right terms and conditions the government must tread softly he said he said that if the government acceded to the demands of boko haram it could serve as a precedent which could propel other aggrieved groups to employ the same tactics opadokun however said that the level of insecurity in the country portended a bleak future he called for innovative strategies to tackle the menace of insecurity effectively the guest lecturer prof anya o anya the chairman of the alpha institute for research in science economics and development aised traced the origin of terrorism and the nigerian experience he said that the attack on the twin towers of the world trade centre in new york in brought about a new consciousness and perception of terror and violence globally according to him nigeria has not been isolated from the development however anya said that violence and insecurity in nigeria had its root in the precolonial era as violence was then used an instrument of social control he said that violence and insecurity went through various stages until the emergence of the boko haram sect whose activities became more political than religious or ethnic as they were being painted he said that boko haram had provided an avenue for the coming of foreign jihadist movements into the country anya stressed that the current state of insecurity was not conducive to the evolution of the kind of economic transformation which the nation needed he however said that nigerians should not think that no good leaders could emerge in the country saying the nigeria of our dream could not be built in the climate of negativity and depreciation of all leaders anya said that pragmatic nation building efforts involved patient and cumulative brickbybrick construction and some degree of mythmaking and even symbolism founded on the ability to select and amplify desirable elements gov babatunde fashola of lagos state mr adetunji oyebanji managing director of mobil oil nigeria and mrs rose uzoma comptrollergeneral nigeria immigration service were given awards of excellence in leadership at the occasion source leadership rd october sani doubts boko haram offer of dialogue with fg from saxone akhaine kaduna the leader of the northern civil society coalition mallam shehu sani has said that the dialogue allegedly offered by boko haram to the federal government is not a genuine one from the leadership of the islamic group he therefore urged president goodluck jonathan to take more proactive steps towards putting an end to the hostilities and insecurity which have caused the nation huge resources and human lives shehu spoke yesterday in kaduna while reacting to the dialogue offer by boko haram which also announced the former head of state and presidential candidate major general muhammadu buhari as part of the negotiating team expected to discuss with the federal government representatives in saudi arabia elaborating on the call for dialogue sani said that from my own study of the group their way of operation and their own strategy and tactics and their own predisposition to dialogue or talks i doubt the authenticity of the statement ascribed to boko haram we all want this violence to come to an end terrorism is an abhorrent crime we cannot continue to function as a country when innocent people and individuals are killed continuously but if we want to get out of this problem we shouldn t deceive ourselves by taking the path of deception a genuine dialogue and peace process can only be done through the government and the genuine leadership of that group you cannot end violence or achieve peace if you are dealing or talking with the wrong people the civil rights activist argued if nigerians should disregard this offer until and unless the leader of the group mallam imam abubakar shekau makes a categorical statement through the utube or an email to nigerians it is then we would take this issue very serious i do not think the group would choose general mohammed buhari to negotiate on their behalf i also do not think that person who is claiming to be speaking on behalf of the group is genuine and i do not also think that the offer made is genuine and credible like i have said earlier issues that have to do with dialogue seizefire and an end to terrorism should come from the same source who is the leader of the group through video and making clear statement about this issue and also when we look at things from the events of the last few days and up till now there is no clear indication on ground that there is any possibility of a seizefire there is also no clear indication on the ground that this violence is coming to an end we should not deceive ourselves with dubious and bogus personalities and individuals who are consistently milking and extorting money from the government in the name of either mediating or benefitting from the violence that is going on we should also note very well that if we have a fake peace offer by a fake person towards a fake peace we will simply have fake hope and that is not in the interest of peace sani continued for me i can only believe that there is a genuine ceasefire and a genuine offer for dialogue if and only if the leader of the group comes out openly and makes such a categorical statement i can also only believe it if i see the cessation of hostility on ground but we should not be complacent people are still being killed on the streets their worship places and nobody is safe wherever any person goes so should a teleconference from anonymous personality within the next few hours impress the government i do not think it is genuine what we should understand clearly is that this is something that is surmountable we can bring an end to terror through force as it was done in sri lanka and algeria or we can also bring an end to terror through dialogue the only time the group boko haram has made a statement and made mention of somebody whom they say in quote they have confidence in is the statement they issued about two months ago where they made it very clear that a freelance journalist who is based in abuja who used to be in borno state is a person whom they have in one way and another been talking to and i believe if the government is clearly interested in bringing this problem to an end it doesn t need a hundred millions of dollars it doesn t need a reporting fake individual to do it it also doesn t need going to saudi arabia why has the government consistently shied away from reaching out to the person whom the group has mentioned in most of its statements which it has issued he continued so as far as i m concerned until and unless i see the leadership of the group making such a statement and unless i see a clear utube video that indicates that the group is ready for peace i won t believe but placing teleconferences by an individual whose name has never been heard also making certain demands and including the name of general muhamadu buhari as part of the dialogue i do not believe that source the guardian rd october buhari may reject boko haram offer by olusola fabiyi abuja there were indications in abuja

the associates of the threetime presidential aspirant have advised against accepting such offer though his spokesman mr yinka odumakin said he odumakin had yet to speak with him since the news broke out on thursday he gave an assurance that buhari would not accept the offer odumakin who is outside the country said in a text message to our correspondent i m out of the country and yet to speak with him but i can tell you authoritatively that he won t accept such offer as he does not support murderous activities his associates and friends were said to have reasoned that accepting the offer might be misconstrued by his political opponents already the congress for progressive change has said that buhari has nothing to do with members of the sect the party while reacting to the terms of peace talks with the federal government as released by the sect on thursday said that the choice of buhari as one of the negotiators by the sect should not be misconstrued to mean he was a member of the dreaded sect a statement by the national publicity secretary of the party mr rotimi fashakin on friday was however silent on whether the party s former presidential candidate would accept the offer or not when called on the telephone to seek clarification on this fashakin said that should not be the issue adding that the behaviour of the peoples democratic partyled central government was to use theboko haramissue to divert attention from its alleged incompetence his statement reads in part our attention in the cpc has been drawn to a widely publicised news that our national leader muhammadu buhari has been appointed to take part in aboko haramfederal government parley as a party we re convinced that this is the latest gambit in the desire of this organically corrupt pdpled federal government in diverting the attention of the unsuspecting nigerian public from the ongoing massive looting of their common patrimony without any scintilla of equivocation general muhammadu buhari has never been directly or remotely connected with any insurrection or insurgency against the nigerian nation and her people he remains the quintessential patriot that continues to magnetise the very best across the ethnoreligious boundaries within the nigerian nationspace he alleged that the pdp was the harbinger of the insecurity travails of the nigerian people for the sole reason of ensuring perpetuity in governance fashakin said that there were three variants ofboko haramin the country the originalboko haramthat is at daggers drawn with the nigerian authority for the extrajudicial killing of their leader the criminalboko haramthat is involved in all criminality for economic reasons and of course the most lethal of all the politicalboko haramwhich this pdpled fg represents the

must not negotiate with terrorists insists rep from isa abdulsalami as the readiness to dialogue with the federal government announced by the boko haram islamic sect continue to generate reactions nationwide a member of the house of representatives representing jos eastjos south federal constituency bitrus kaze has said nigeria must not in any way negotiate with terrorists kaze in a press statement in jos on friday in reaction to the sect s choice of former head of state gen muhammadu buhari as intermediary between them and government declared anyone who has been following the internecine violence perpetrated especially north of the niger by these merchants of death should understand their choice of buhari eventually the men behind the masks are beginning to unveil in my view buhari like the boko haram cannot be trusted to negotiate for sustainable peace in nigeria in the buildup to the presidential elections buhari was reported to have asked muslims across the country to vote only for the presidential candidate that would defend and uphold islam even before the emergence of boko haram buhari had vowed not to stop the agitation for the total implementation of the sharia in the country kaze added if it is too much to say buhari has a soft spot for boko haram the incontrovertible facts show that he has consistently instigated violence in nigeria in his bid to rule nigeria again buhari ordered his supporters in to finish anyone who tampers with the votes whatever that means sheik lemu may have attempted although unsuccessfully to vindicate him at least his presidential panel on post elections violence acknowledged buhari s provocative utterances which according to them appeared to have been misconstrued by many voters to include recourse to violence nigerians won t forget in a hurry that after his woeful loss to president goodluck jonathan many voters resorted to violence leading to unquantifiable loss of innocent lives and property he said against this backdrop therefore it is unthinkable that anyone will expect peace from an engagement with an advocate of violence like buhari by nature thorn bushes do not yield bananas the terms under which boko haram terrorists are seeking negotiations in the first place invariably offend the constitution of the federal republic of nigeria as amended which government has sworn to uphold protect and defend according to him any government that considers as cardinal the protection of lives and property of its citizens cannot contemplate any negotiation with those demanding for the release of captured terrorists who are in the custody of security agencies awaiting trial a government that has not compensated victims or reconstructed any place of worship destroyed by these suicide bombers has no business sitting at the same table with terrorists under any guise on the verge of the th anniversary of nigeria s amalgamation the president cannot afford to be deceived into mortgaging nigeria s national sovereignty in the name of dialoguing with terrorists in saudi arabia or anywhere kaze said there is no country in the whole wide world that has ever succeeded in checkmating terrorists by negotiating on their terms adding peace and terror like light and darkness do not and will never mix unconfirmed reports said buhari hasdeclined the intermediary role source

further terror attacks as a prelude to entering into dialogue with the federal government the group which is demanding that talks between it and government must be held in saudi arabia said in a telephone interview with journalists in maiduguri that it was ready for peace talks should government meet its demands it also suggested the names of former head of state majorgeneral muhammadu buhari and dr shettima ali monguno among others to be on the government delegation that will meet with its representatives for dialogue the federal government in a cautious reaction to the peace offer restated its commitment to ensuring that peace reigns in nigeria selfacclaimed spokesman of the group abu mohammed ibn abdulazeez who also laid claims to being the secondincommand amir to the group s

government should compensate the group and rebuild its places of worship which were destroyed during the uprising in addition all boko haram members in the custody of security agencies must be released with immediate effect the group said he equally said all their wives who were displaced following the crisis as well as their children must be rehabilitated to allow their integration into

senator bukar abba ibrahim ambassador gaji galtimari mrs aisha alkali wakil and her husband mr alkali wakil according to abdulazeez the dialogue must not take place in nigeria but saudi arabia

comprising himself abdulazeez abu abbas sheikh ibrahim yusuf sheikh sani kontogora and mamman nur to meet with government if all the preconditions are met he dissociated the group from the spate of killings and wanton destruction of property being perpetrated recently in maiduguri saying that such attacks were politically motivated he accused politicians enmeshed in power struggle in the borno emirate council government or otherwise of being behind the violence the federal government in a swift reaction to the peace offer by the islamic sect was noncommittal rather it restated its commitment to ensuring that peace reigns in nigeria special adviser to the president on media and publicity dr reuben abati in a statement after the boko haram offer said it is important to restate the position of government in this matter the federal government is committed to peace and security for the benefit of all nigerians if what the proposed ceasefire is intended to achieve are the objectives of peace and security then it is a welcome development don t forget that president jonathan had made it clear that if the people behind boko haram are ready to come forward and table their grievances then government will be willing to listen to those grievances there have been attempts before now by concerned persons to reach out to the boko haram through back channels in response to government s call that all efforts should be made to resolve the problem i suspect that this latest development may be related to that definitely government is determined to ensure peace peace and peace and protect the rule of law and at the same time see that justice is done where wrongs have been committed meanwhile borno state governor alhaji kashim shettima yesterday urged security agencies to thoroughly investigate allegations that some politicians are behind the boko haram operations and if necessary arrest those with proven links to the terrorist group the governor told state house

ibrahim shettima of borno state also thursday said security agencies should be allowed to do their job on those they suspect are sponsors or sympathisers of the boko haram sect shettima told state house correspondents after a meeting of the national economic council that the security challenge in the country required the efforts of all nigerians to overcome meanwhile spokesman of the group abu mohammed ibn abdulazeez who doubles as the secondincommand amir to their leader imam abubakar shekau made the group s intention known in a teleconference with journalists in maiduguri thursday mediatorsabdulazeez said other people who could mediate with the government if its conditions were met include dr shettima ali monguno former yobe state governor bukar abba ibrahim ambassador gaji galtimari and hajia aisha wakil and her husband alkali wakil dialogue venuehe insisted however that such dialogue must not take place in nigeria but saudi arabiaaccording to him the choice of saudi arabia was informed by the insincerity of the nigeria government for dialogue and its betrayal in the past abdulazeez insisted that for the group to ceasefire completely the government must not only apprehend but prosecute senator modu sheriff according to the laws of the land as well as compensate members of the group and rebuild their places of worship destroyed during uprising which led to the alleged murder of their leader mohammed yusuf conditions for ceasefirethe boko haram spokesman further stressed that all their members who were arrested and are under the custody of security agencies must be released immediately just as their wives and children who were displaced following the crises should be rehabilitated into the society to allow room for the much talked about dialogue with the federal government commenting on the series of recent killings and destruction of property in maiduguri abu abdulazeez dissociated boko haram from the action saying such attacks were not only politicallymotivated but carried out by those seeking power in the borno emirate council or in government he stressed that recent killings and destructions in maiduguri were against the ideology of the sect which he said was fighting the cause of allah abdulazeez also said the burning of old and newlyconstructed primary schools witnessed across the state were not carried out by the sect insisting that they were perpetrated by aggrieved politicians who were denied contracts by the state government last february the group had also nominated monguno bukar ibrahim aisha wakil and jinadu idris as part of a team to mediate between it and the federal government but the negotiation never got off buhari reactsthursday was however the first time the group would be proposing gen buhari as part of a mediation team between it and the federal government buhari who returned to kaduna from daura katsina state yesterday evening said he was yet to be formally contacted on the development buba galadima an associate of the former head of state speaking on behalf of the general said his first reaction is that he has not heard about this news and nobody has contacted him he said he wouldn t want to say anything on this matter that has not yet been authenticated but he remains prayerful that peace and tranquility will return to this country sheriff s wordsmeanwhile sheriff who spoke in abuja on the issue of the involvement of politicians with boko haram said i think it is within the realm and the responsibility of the security agencies to unearth the truth i am more of a developmental politician and i am more interested in addressing the core issues that make our society vulnerable to the antics of religious bigots and all sorts of misfits that are indoctrinating our young ones to these things i don t want to dabble into the realm of the security agencies neither do i want to respond to allegations and accusations from any quarter but it is the responsibility of security agencies to unearth those behind boko haram a veteran journalist dele giwa said an evil done by man to man will be rewarded if not now then later if not by man then certainly by god but the day of evil over good is only temporary i think the problem at hand goes beyond politics the underlying factor is poverty the most important thing is how we can resolve this problem and restore harmony peace and how to eradicate endemic poverty which is the underlying factor of the whole crisis i want to solicit for the media not to dwell on sensationalism but proper conflict resolution and move our society forward its pains me if a single person is killed by boko haram when innocent souls are lost its sheer hooliganism its sheer madness for anybody to burn a place of worship these are the issue agitating my mind and i don t want to dwell on politics for now source vanguard nd november boko haram gives terms for talks with government from madu onuorah johnabba ogbodo lemmy ughegbe

killings after about three years of keeping the country on the brink of disintegration owing to the violence it regularly inflicted on it boko haram may have decided to dialogue with the federal government but the group wants the dialogue to hold on its terms it says the talks should take place in saudi arabia it should be paid compensation and former borno state governor ali modu sheriff who was arrested by the police in connection with the activities of the group and its members being held should be released former head of state majgen muhammadu buhari rtd is among top northerners the group has chosen to negotiate on its behalf with the federal and borno state governments the conditions of negotiation were disclosed yesterday in maiduguri by the newly appointed spokesman of boko haram abu mohammed ibn abdulaziz in a teleconference with reporters he said to bring an end to these attacks bombings killings and arrests of our members in nigeria we have been mandated by our leader imam abubakar shekau to appoint high members elders and others from the northeast subregion to dialogue with the borno state and federal governments of nigeria in a neutral state of saudi arabia he said five members of the group were mandated to liaise with a fivemember committee of borno elders to dialogue with the federal government the nigerian mediators according to him include alhaji shettima ali monguno buhari sen bukar abba ibrahim amb gaji galtimari and aisha wakil and her husband on a neutral centre for the dialogue abdulaziz said we insist on having the dialogue in saudi arabia because the federal government has betrayed us on two different occasions the committee members for dialogue comprise my humble self abu mohammed abdulaziz shiek abu abass shiek ibrahim yusuf shiek sani kontagora and mamman nur he said we are not after anything but the federal government should fulfill three conditions on which the announced dialogue could commence compensation of our members is one of the three main conditions for this dialogue with government while the immediate past governor of borno state sen ali modu sheriff arrested by the police and our members incarcerated in various prisons in the country should be released this will also facilitate dialogue with the federal government in the holy land of saudi arabia if the federal government likes peace we will appreciate it and we should be compensated the compensation he added should be made directly by the federal government he however noted that armed bandits hoodlums and assassins hide under the cover of boko haram to attack kill people torch schools telecoms masts and public buildings asked about the group s relationship with the media abdulaziz said we don t have any problem with the nigerian press they should however not write what we did not say to the press i am now appointed second in command of the boko haram sect spokesman also it was learnt that some suspected members of boko haram who were recently arrested in minna niger state capital by a combined team of military and police anti terrorist squad in connection with bomb factories in the suburb of minna have confessed to the killings of policemen in parts of the state in recent times no fewer than seven policemen have been killed by gunmen suspected to be members of boko haram while on their duty posts at various locations in minna and other parts of the state in the last five months the state commissioner of police mrs desire nsirim disclosed this in minna on wednesday during an interactive session with the top management workers of the state s ministry of livestockfisheries led by its commissioner dr isah yahaya vatsa when she paid a familiarisation visit to the ministry however in a damning report the amnesty international yesterday carpeted nigerian security outfits over their response to acts of terrorism masterminded by boko haram saying that the forces response was a sorry continuation of the cycle of violence in the report released in abuja by the secretary general of the global body salil shetty it noted the atrocious acts of the dreaded sect and decried the serious human rights violations perpetrated by nigerian security operatives in response to these acts of terrorism including enforced disappearance torture extrajudicial executions torching of homes and detention without trials the report titled nigeria trapped in the circle of violence documents these violent acts by boko haram and the response of the nigerian security forces against persons suspected to be members of the group presenting the report in abuja shetty noted that the cycle of attack and counter attack had been marked by unlawful violence on both sides with devastating consequences for the human rights of those trapped in the middle people are living in climate of fear and insecurity vulnerable to attack from boko haram and facing human rights violations at the hands of the very state security forces which should be protecting them shetty stated the secretary general observed that gross human rights abuses including murder burning down schools and churches and attacking media houses and journalists had been committed by boko haram the report documents the increasing climate of fear where people are too scared to report crimes and journalists would not cover them out of fear for their own safety the report condemns security agencies which it claims acted with little regard for rule of law and human rights in their actions targeting boko haram elements but the nigeria police force npf has expressed concern over the report compiled by amnesty international on human rights situation in the country a statement by the deputy force public relations officer frank mabah yesterday said in view of the seriousness attached to the report by the police it had begun a critical study with a view to establishing its veracity or otherwise the statement read a recent amnesty international report dated november has just been received by relevant authority of the nigeria police as a responsible law enforcement agency the nigeria police force takes all criticisms against its organisation seriously consequently the police authority has begun a comprehensive and critical study of the report with a view to establishing its veracity and relevance vis vis our contemporary security challenges and needs bearing in mind that the force has no monopoly of knowledge the police high command on the strength of the report will not hesitate to accept honest and factual recommendations if any contained therein and initiate appropriate reforms where necessary however the force is deeply concerned over a key research methodology adopted by amnesty international in compiling its report the fact that most of the sources of the content of the report are not named and thus not open to confirmation or reconciliation puts the authenticity credibility and legitimacy of the report in question in the same vein the nigerian military yesterday dismissed the report of the amnesty international the director defence information col muhammed yerima told the guardian yesterday that there is no truth whatsoever in what amnesty international said in regard to the role security forces have been playing in the fight against the boko haram group the report is biased and unsubstantiated you cannot have a report like this without interviewing boko haram or the security forces and you just pick your stories on the streets and come up with a cooked story and say that the nigerian security forces have violated the human rights of boko haram members or that the security forces are involved in human rights abuses on the accusation by amnesty international that the military has been carrying out detention without trial yerima explained that if we arrest any of the suspects either during stop and search operation or during encounter with armed groups we will first of all interview them on whether they are members of boko haram or not and members of the security forces like the state security services and the police join as it is a combined interrogation after sifting the information if the person is involved in any criminal activity we will hand him over to the police for prosecution if he is not we release him we don t keep people unnecessarily or longer than necessary as for the accusation of extrajudicial killings being caught in a crossfire is not extrajudicial killings it is unfortunate it can happen to anybody either it hits us passersby or the members of the boko haram when it is extrajudicial killing you are talking of tying a person down or handcuffing somebody and killing him that is unfair and unnecessary and it is against international tenets the issue of crossfire can happen anywhere in the world but the truth of the matter is that such casualties are not intentional or intended nobody not the security forces are there on duty to kill anyone like that source the guardian st novembermenu title home lifestyle politics y daily opinion enterprise tv teen politico long readhome topics donate expand all back to top

united states joint typhoon warning center jtwc started to monitor a tropical low that had developed within a marginal environment for further development over the gulf of carpentaria over the next two days the cyclone slightly developed further before the system made landfall to the southwest of borroloola early on january where the possibility for further development became stifled by january the system completed a clockwise loop before reemerging into the gulf of carpentaria once back over water the system quickly organised and strengthened into tropical cyclone oswald early on january at the same time the jtwc began monitoring the system as tropical cyclone p radar imagery from mornington island depicted a welldefined lowlevel circulation with defined banding features wrapping into the centre situated in a very moist air mass and over the warm waters of the gulf some intensification was expected before oswald struck the cape york peninsula approximately hours after being named the storm made its second landfall north of kowanyama with winds of kmh mph and the final advisory was issued by the tcwc in brisbane although over land the system was able to maintain a defined circulation and gradually reorganised as it moved southwestward by january deep convection redeveloped over the circulation and a strong monsoonal flow became established to its north a high pressure system over new zealand blocked the low pressure system from moving east away from the queensland coast allowing the low to move slowly along the queensland coast also causing it to stall near rockhampton and in southern queensland feeding moist air from the coral sea into the low which resulted in a large area of convective activity with associated heavy rainfall and a low pressure trough over new south wales allowed the low to move south into the tasman sea favourable upperlevel conditions and ample moisture allowed the system to maintain its identity despite remaining over land for a

british amritsar massacre thousands of people gathered at the jallianwala bagh public gardens in amritsar on april british colonial authorities had banned public meetings and a general was sent in to disperse the crowds without warning he blocked the exits and ordered his riflemen to open fire they stopped minutes later when their ammunition ran out the death toll is disputed an inquiry set up by the colonial authorities put the figure at but indian sources put it nearer to past prime ministers have expressed their regret but mr cameron is the first to pay his respects at the site in person the prime minister laid a wreath at the jallianwala bagh memorial bowing his head and standing in silence the killings were condemned by the british at the time war secretary winston churchill described them as quotmonstrousquot in during her visit in the queen said it was a quotdistressingquot example of the quotmoments of sadnessquot in the history between britain and india mr cameron wants his visit to focus on more positive ties of history particularly by visiting the golden temple at amritsar the holiest site in the sikh religion operation blue star enraged many sikhs and the indian prime minister indira gandhi was assassinated by two of her sikh bodyguards retired lieutenant general kuldip singh brar who led operation blue star was attacked in london during a visit in

husband vasu mal kapoor was shot dead at jallianwala bagh it was as if the world had ended for her but she had to live for her child she took charge of the clothes shop that her husband ran and raised her family my greatgrandfather s name is in the government records we still run that shop and think of them everyday we grew up hating what had happened here but when we heard that prime minister cameron was coming here and there was a possibility of his apologising we hoped that our wounds would heal but our hopes are shattered it seems he came here on a political visit not to pay tributes to the martyrs clearly he wanted to impress the punjabi voters in the uk and he has the upcoming british elections in mind it is not a big deal that he came here but it would have been a big deal had he apologised here mr cameron said the massacre was quotshamefulquot but that s his personal feeling that s what he has recorded here he should have apologised to the families of those who took bullets on their chests nanish behl my grandfather khushi ram died here he was only my father was only three when tragedy struck my grandmother had to do whatever she could to raise the family alone there were no jobs then and it was not common for women to go out yet she managed it we heard about the massacre and we saw the hardships that my family went through and after all this we could at least expect an apology from the british prime minister we wanted to meet mr cameron i don t know why the government did not allow us to do that instead they cordoned off the entire area and we were not allowed in had he called the massacre shameful in front of us it would have given us a lot of peace we were hopeful we would be called here and hear the prime minister s apology but by not saying sorry mr cameron has rubbed salt into our wounds before the queen did not say sorry during her visit to amritsar in and now the prime minister has not apologised sukumar mukherjee read about bbc news

at last years london olympics womens wrestling was added to the olympics at the athens games wrestling will now join seven other sports in applying for inclusion in the others are a combined bid from baseball and softball karate squash roller sports sport climbing wakeboarding and wushu they will be vying for a single opening in the ioc executive board will meet in may in st petersburg russia to decide which sport or sports to propose for inclusion the final vote will be made at the ioc session or general assembly in september in buenos aires argentina it is extremely unlikely that wrestling would be voted back in so soon after being removed by the executive board todays decision is not final adams said the session is sovereign and the session will make the final decision the last sports removed from the olympics were baseball and softball voted out by the ioc in and off the program since the beijing games golf and rugby will be joining the program at the games in rio de janeiro

paid off in the end we have promised things and we have delivered he said after tuesdays decision that gives me a great feeling it also gives me new energy to develop our sport further and never give up modern pentathlon also benefited from the work of juan antonio samaranch jr the son of the former ioc president who is a uipm vice president and member of the ioc board we were considered weak in

blownin glass the intense light from the meteor momentarily times brighter than the sun led to over cases of eye pain and people subsequently reported temporary flash blindness twenty people reported ultraviolet burns similar to sunburn possibly intensified by the presence of snow on the ground vladimir petrov when meeting with scientists to assess the damage reported that he sustained so much sunburn from the meteor that the skin flaked only days later a fourthgrade teacher in chelyabinsk yulia karbysheva was hailed as a hero after saving children from imploding window glass cuts despite not knowing the origin of the intense flash of light karbysheva thought it prudent to take precautionary measures by ordering her students to stay away from the rooms windows and to perform a duck and cover maneuver karbysheva who remained standing was seriously lacerated when the blast arrived and window glass severed a tendon in one of her arms however none of her students whom she ordered to hide under their desks suffered cuts after the air blast car alarms went off and mobile phone networks were overloaded with calls office buildings in chelyabinsk were evacuated classes for all chelyabinsk schools were cancelled mainly due to broken windows at least children were injured when the windows of a school and kindergarten were blown in at following the event government officials in chelyabinsk asked parents to take their children home from schools media coverageedit external video meteor air burst two videos first from a car and from street on youtube extensive dash cam footage from the atmospheric entry onwards on youtube explosion eyewitness on youtube bright light and sound recorded by a stationary surveillance camera on youtube video of meteor explosion that stirred panic in urals region on youtube the russian government put out a brief statement within an hour of the event but the event was first covered in the us by hockey blog russian machine never breaks heavy coverage by the international media had begun by the time the associated press put out a brief report with the russian governments confirmation less than two hours afterwards less than hours after the meteor impact videos of the meteor and its aftermath had been viewed millions of times the number of injuries caused by the asteroid led the internetsearch giant google to remove a google doodle from their website created for the predicted pending arrival of another asteroid da new york city planetarium director neil degrasse tyson stated the chelyabinsk meteor was unpredicted because no attempt had been made to find and catalogue every metre nearearth object in television media interviews shortly afterwards tyson also noted the disturbing closeness of the two completely unrelated events on march a broadcast episode of nova titled meteor strike documented the chelyabinsk meteor including the large amounts of meteoritic science revealed by the numerous videos of the airburst posted online by ordinary citizens the nova program called the video documentation and the related scientific discoveries of the airburst unprecedented the documentary also discussed the much greater tragedy that could have been had the asteroid entered the earths atmosphere more steeply impactor orbital parametersedit comparison of the former orbit of the chelyabinsk meteor larger elliptical blue orbit and asteroid da smaller circular blue orbit showing that they are dissimilar preliminary calculations rapidly showed the object was not related to long predicted february close approach of what was at the time known as asteroid da later named duende that passed the earth hours later at a distance of km the sodankyl geophysical observatory russian sources the european space agency nasa and the royal astronomical society all indicated the two objects could not have been related because the two asteroids had widely different trajectories see alsoedit referencesedit

Page:home uk news sports us showbiz australia femail health science money video travel columnists newest oldest best rated worst rated carpool cooking quick easy recipe ideas for the entire family more share picture copy link to paste in your message find out more find out moredownton abbey spoiler downton abbey season spoiler lady mary is kissing which suitor sign in to wetpaint i knew theyx d end up together ix m not so sure could just be a friendly peck like us to see how many agree id rather sign in raquo your activity collapsel says march at am yes i completely agree with you i posted something similar to your thoughts below reply morgen says march at pm helloh lord gillinghunk reply shay says march at pm ugh don t like this casting news at all read elsewhere julian ovenden from foyle s war has also been added to the cast as a fellow aristo he would be more suitable for lady mary also not thrilled about the return of the crass maclaine didn t she chew enough of the elegant scenery the last time around cannot hold a candle to dame maggie reply jackie napoli says march at pm saw weekend with cullen a terrific actor very different from the actor who left his eyes express alot and very sexy without saying a word i don t think he ll fall in love with mary anxious to know what happens to tom reply annie blue says march at am julian oveden the actor who played foyle s son in foyle s war perfect for mary don t care for the welsh guy he seems perhaps not the right type for a lady hope edith has a good romance like this actress who plays edith one of the best i would say along with maggie smith like the editor hope that works out with his wife perhaps being allowed a divorce and would be nice to see something good for daisy she is being left behind too much lately i like her relationship with her father in law really nice also tom branson the only sexy guy in the show more more more of him and no maids or nursery attendants for him please the new footman james is great just not a relationship with the nasty thomas please all wrong why not a friendship with daisy reply mary solum says march at am i would really like for daisy to leave downton and start taking over her fatherin law s farm she could be a business woman and sell produce to downton and other businesses in the area reply annie blue says march at am hi mary daisy s father in law is quite young probably s early s but i do think it would be good for her to visit with him more often to start learning and perhaps helping him with her baked goods and then perhaps alfred would go along with her and then that romance could pick up and be a happy time for daisy and her father in law who would then have a new family to keep in company a fairy tale perhaps but maybe just a perfect life for daisy and her father in law and ultimately alfred or maybe even james one of them in any event would be grand future for all also remembering that james is alone with no family this would make it a good thing after all alfred has his aunt o brien reply kay says march at am i m pulling for lady edith the poor girl has been pushed to the left by literally everyone including her own parents for gid s sake and all because she was the least beautiful daughter i hope she finds her place in life by becoming a firebrand for women s rights and becomes a leader outside of that closed aristocratic world it seems that she branson and mrs crawley would be natural allies in their ideas for social changes and the historical backdrop is perfect for such a storyline wouldn t it be really a great twist if daisy took up her father in law on his offer started a line of commercial food products and mrs patmore and the rest all ended up working for her reply louise says march at am it s nigel harman not nigle reply l says march at am i really wish tptb weren t giving mary a new love interest so soon after matthew s death she seems like someone who doesn t love easily and isn t easy to love i just don t buy her opening her heart to someone else why can t she just be a single mother for a while and look after her son s inheritence as for tom cullen yep he s definitely good looking but as i said i could do without the new romance between mary and his character give edith a love story instead reply matt webb mitovich says march at am there s a time jump httptvlinecom downtonabbeyseason spoilersmatthewfuneraltimejump reply shaun says march at am just because time went by won t make her less prickly and standoffish reply lyn says march at am well his look certainly is different from that of the bland foppish matthew might be a little too much temptation for the flirty blond cousin they re bringing in next season in any case i agree with those who are most interested in seeing edith get her chance at happiness finally reply jules says march at am harriet walter has no s at the end of her walter with her on board i would love to see edward petherbridge who played lord peter wimsey to her harriet vane reply elle says march at pm this is so stupid basically the entire show revolved around matthew amp mary and one of his last lines ever was about how much he and mary will always love each other there s honestly no way that mary would get over her and matthew s relationship which honestly spanned like years let s be real this quickly right after his death if ever i hate dan stevens for leaving but julian fellowes you re doing your characters a great disservice reply kavan says march at pm this is my perspective as well trying to rush mary back into a romantic pairing is really ignoring mary s character she waited two years just to hope for another chance i think it would take her much more than six months to even contemplate another man jf really is just rushing at trying a new pairing and it feels so antimary reply hipper says march at pm tom cullen was brilliant in weekend good for him reply vetle says march at pm agreed weekend is a good film reply george says july at pm tom cullen is an amazing actor in weekend everyone should see it he will be absolutely amazing at anything he does in downton abby can t wait to see him again reply tina says march at pm as long as michelle dockery is in da i will keep watching she is a brilliant female actori hope she will be more noticed by casting directors and give her a leading role in a good moviemichelle thanks for continuing on your role in dasuch loyalty to your character and of course to us da fanatics reply karen says march at pm the most interesting triangle of the season was the interplay of lord grantham matthew and branson i was looking forward to seeing them work through their relationships mary is just tiring to watch so stuck in a mindset can t imagine her being interesting without matthew reply shannon says march at am loved tom cullen in weekend he did a fabulous job and i m looking forward to him being on downton reply eveateden says march at pm ack i can t wait another months need more da now reply vivian james says march at pm i predict that tom branson will be the next global heartthrob replacing matthew crawley and by the way i hope julian ovenden from foyle s war will be mary s next beau he is really good looking and a fine actor reply annie blue says march at pm i would say tom branson is already the hearthrob of downton abbey even when mathew was around mathew handsome and all that but branson has that special sexy something for the ladies hope they do make foyle s son the true next to be for mary so long to wait arghhhhhh reply vivian james says march at pm i hope they develop a love interest for tom very carefully it can t be mary because she is too much of a snob the woman for tom has to have a lot of class sybil will be hard to replaceduplicate i certainly hope julian f will not try to use rose and tom together that would be an insult to sybil s memory can you tell me how to watch the show early in the us apparently i am the only computer dufuss in the us thanks reply annie blue says march at pm hi vivian they have just started filming season so i doubt we will have the opportunity of seeing it before they finish i know there is a way when it shows in the uk to see it online and if anybody knows the secret fess up and ta muchly i m in canada so waiting also i do wish they would show it earlier here also tom would definitely not work with marie no way not her type she is not his type either according to the way the characters are cast and portrayed by julian the marvelous sybil is also not right and i think rose is toooo young he is more serious now and i would think julian would have a pretty but serious minded young woman to come along for tom but not for a few years i would think his daughter growing up will keep him much more in line with the ways of the gentry in downton abbey meantime i really want to see good things for edith i really like that character a lot and the actress playing her is excellent good work entire reality good in all ways so many really good actors in this production i think that is what is keeping the audience enthralled checking out for tonight later reply annie blue says march at pm oops big mistake in my comment on sybilll slip of the fingers on the keypad after sybil tom would not look at either of her two sisters both opposite to his sybil it would have to be someone completely different and more like sybil though perhaps a little quieter and of a good family won t happen season well i doubt it will no matter the time jumps cheers and love coming in for news stephanie says march at am why are a lot of you giving the character mary crap michelle dockery isn t responsible for the roll she is playing she is playing it how it was written and all the characters have different storyline of course michelles character is going to be in the spotlight she is the eldest daughter all the responsibility falls onto her especially now that her son is the next earl of grantham she has not only lost her husband but her sister to and of course that is going to be written to effect her character i really hope that the give her character some different storyline and that they don t just make her into a sad depressed character because that s not what she is i also can t wait to see what storyline all the other cast get especially with there being new cast members and even the o brien has left it won t effect the show because produces have said the door is being left open reply mike says may at am i am sorry but mathew s son can not inherit the estate and title because his father mathew died before inheriting it from lord grantham who would have to die before him to inherit it reply ex fromtheleft exfromtheleft says march at am why tv shows think that we viewers can not take interest in a woman grieving her loved husband and raising her child without having to be interested in a new man is beyond me reply downtonabbey fan says march at am why does mary need a new man surely she can be left th grieve the love of her life i mean a lady doesn t need a man to be interesting and after all mary and matthew had been through so much together as a couple and i think landing mary onto some other bloke is cold and heartless especially for fans of matthew whom will probably be forgotten about a few episodes in i love how marys character has changed from being arrogant and self absorbed to a loving and caring wife and in my personal opinion no man will ever fill matthews shoes reply ellie says march at am i agree and im sorry to say but i would have prefered the shoe to end than mary and matthews relationship to end like that i love the show but this storyline doesnt do it justice reply joann says may at am i would rather have seen another actor playing the part of matthew than for him to have died after the long delay i think it would have been accepted better than this reply mike says may at am the big question now that mathew is dead is who will the be next heir not his son mathew would have to be alive when lord grantham dies to inherit downton and then pass it on to his son the same way mathew inherited the estate of reggie swire how about this lets have patrick return with proof of his identity and regain his rightful place as heir then have him and edith fall in love get married and she becomes the next countess of downton and mary get nothing jilian fellows are you reading this reply corbin says may at pm i was so sad that matthew died but i think that every character is important even lady mary to giving the show it s amazing sensation that is downton abbey reply sarahsmilesca says june at am i don t understand why they just did not get other actors to play both sybil and matthew because the story lines for both characters are really important to the central plot especially matthew matthew is the only thing that makes mary s character tolerable i like stevens work well enough but there are plenty of good british actors that could have pulled it off the audience would have loved any good actor by the end of th season if the writing and the acting were good enough because matthew was a wonderful character that is loved because of who he isnot because of who is playing him it has been done before dumbledore from hp movies is a good example of how it was done in the past and done well i predict the show is going to go down the tube this season not even sure i want to watch it now i have felt that way since the death of sybil killing off lovable characters is the best way to ruin a show reply edward lewis says august at pm it just seems so wrong for the writers to portray members of the british nobility making major mistakes in grammar it weakens their credibility of those characters reply veryupset says october at pm there is no effing way mary would have gotten over matthew the way she loved him it breaks my heart i am completely done with this show julian fellowes writing is getting worse and worse and everybody is acting out of character and i wish they d stopped at the end of season i really do reply joann says march at am i am so let

downton hello jason stathamso is he filming for downton or not if he is can we then expect to see jason statham in series five we can only hope and pray however julians caption would be rather more likely to imply that hes currently working on a project that isnt downton related and he s wearing what appears to be a us military uniform but if that is the case then are we to see charles blake

hospital and afterward described her as one of the best while theories have been floated neither turkish nor us authorities have detailed why they think sanli blew himself up prior to friday he was known to us and other intelligence agencies a us law enforcement source told cnn whatever sanlis rationale the explosion spurred security clampdowns at diplomatic facilities in turkey plus messages of condolences and solidarity turkish prime minster recep tayyip erdogan called it an attack against the peace and welfare of our country yet the violence reverberated well beyond turkeys borders however especially in the nation whose embassy was targeted the spotlight on us diplomatic installations was already intense after violence last september in egypt tunisia and libya where ambassador christopher stevens was one of four americans killed in benghazi us rep ed royce said fridays explosion in turkey served as yet another stark reminder of the constant terrorist threat against us facilities personnel and interests aboard coming after benghazi it underscores the need for a comprehensive review of security at our diplomatic posts said royce a california republican and chairman of house foreign affairs committee he exploded at the guard the bomber had first gone to the rear access of the embassy then went to a checkpoint on the buildings perimeter where ids are checked explained us state department spokeswoman victoria nuland according to law enforcement sources working on the investigation sanli blew himself up on a walkway for embassy employees and their guests he exploded at the guard nuland explained the guard akarsu on one side of the security barrier was killed two guards on the other side of the glass survived said the state department spokeswoman the blast blew a hole in what appeared to be a building that is part of the compounds outer gate images from cnn sister network cnn turk showed this was all part of a large complex that includes blast doors reinforced windows and a series of metal detectors that visitors must navigate before reaching embassy offices are you there send us your photos and videos but please stay safe the attack stirred swift condemnations as well as fresh security precautions the us embassy in ankara subsequently put out a statement telling americans not to visit that facility or us consulates in istanbul or adana until further notice portions of paris avenue where the targeted embassy is located were shut down according to anadolu news germany and france meanwhile were among the countries who tightened their security in the wake of the blast the us ambassador said in a statement that hed paid my respects to the family of the turkish hero who stood guard for us every day calling him well trained and committed to his job ricciardone praised the late guard as a good excellent professional guard who died defending the turks and the americans who work at the embassy the ambassador also talked about

she serves her country by getting the truth to the turkish people the ambassador said she i think is one of the best not first brush with terror for turkey us fridays blast was hardly turkeys first brush with terror at the nexus of europe and asia and with deep roots in the muslim and christian spheres turkey has long been a boiling pot and occasionally a target in recent years it has been site of many acts of political violence from groups such as leftist anarchists kurdish separatists islamists and al qaeda hasan selim ozertem a security expert at the international strategic research organization in ankara said fridays attack could be related to recent arrests of dhkpc members since the beginning of january members of the group have been taken into custody he said adding that turkish police have been closely focusing on the group over the past five years the dhkpc was established in the s ozertem said that one plausible theory is the group is trying to send a message to turkish authorities by attacking the us embassy because it is near the turkish parliament building dhkpc has a track record as a subcontractor group for other militant outfits and it is also believed to have relationships with states in the region such as syria and iran ozertem said the group has a relationship with the pkk the kurdistan workers party which has been at odds with turkeys government for some time ozertem said the attack could be linked to negotiations between the pkk and turkish government another possibility is that syria or iran could be involved considering the recent deployment of patriot missiles in turkey as a defense against possible missiles from syria the explosion occurred as about us military personnel are moving patriot missile defense equipment to a turkish base as part of an effort to defend the country from possible attack from syria the first battery became operational last saturday in the city of adana nato said and more equipment arrived wednesday in the port city of iskenderun erdogan however ruled out that fridays attack had anything to do with syria according to an interview on the private habertuk channel later reported by andolu of course this may have to do primarily with the united states itself independent of anything involving turkey or its government while the us embassy in ankara has not seen this kind of incident in decades in three police officers died in a shootout with assailants outside the us consulate in istanbul three attackers died in the incident which the us ambassador at the time called an obvious act of terrorism one of the attackers in that incident was believed to have trained with al qaeda in pakistans waziristan region read more at cnn turk cnns ivan watson reported from turkey and greg

insulindependent diabetes results when the body doesnt produce enough insulin or is unable to use insulin properly a condition called insulin resistance this is the most common form of diabetes accounting for of all cases it usually occurs in people who are over overweight and have a family history of the disease although it is also becoming more common in younger people particularly adolescents research indicates that type diabetes is caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors many risk factors make people more likely to develop the disease including obesity high cholesterol high blood pressure and physical inactivity type diabetes is more common among native americans african americans latinos and asian americanspacific islanders also people who develop diabetes while pregnant a condition called gestational diabetes are more likely to develop type diabetes later in life as are people with prediabetes or the metabolic syndrome two diseases that are closely related to type diabetes type diabetes research people who live with type diabetes must monitor their blood glucose and be sure to keep it in a healthy range through a combination of diet and physical activity their doctors may prescribe medications to decrease insulin resistance and although their bodies can still produce some insulin they may also need to take an additional dosage in any case keeping blood glucose as close to normal as possible is very important because poor glucose control is associated with an increased risk of serious complications including damage to blood vessels vascular complications which may lead to eye heart and kidney disease type diabetes research focuses on four main areas prediction and prevention of the disease through lifestyle modification and medications especially because it may develop very slowly over time education and health service programs that ensure patients know everything they need to do to manage the disease new technology and medications to combat insulin resistance and help patients regulate blood glucose evaluated through clinical trials prevention and reversal of diabetes complications through eye kidney and vascular cell biology research joslin researchers are searching for answers who is at risk for type diabetes and what are the first signs of the disease is there a way to reverse insulin resistance and restore insulin sensitivity what physical differences exist between people with type diabetes and those without why does it tend to run in families what new technologies make diabetes management easier for patients how do diabetes complications develop and how might they be prevented through medication education or health services most commonly used terms insulin hormone made by the islet cells of the pancreas insulin controls the amount of sugar in the blood by moving it into the cells where it can be used for energy insulin resistance condition in which cells no longer respond well to insulin the body responds by secreting more insulin into the bloodstream in an effort to reduce blood glucose levels exercise weight loss and certain medications may reduce insulin resistance insulin sensitivity the opposite of insulin resistance it is the degree to which cells respond to a particular dose of insulin by lowering blood glucose levels blood glucose the main sugar that the body makes from food and the bodys main source of energy cells cannot use glucose without the help of insulin also called blood sugar metabolic syndrome cluster of conditions also known as syndrome x that increase the risk of heart disease classified by three or more of the following abdominal obesity high cholesterol or triglycerides high blood pressure and high blood glucose prediabetes higher than normal fasting blood glucose level that is not yet high enough to be classified as diabetes clinical trials carefully controlled studies that are conducted to test the effectiveness and safety of new drugs medical

research clinical trials research faculty diabetes self management education program news articles of interest support new research glossarysite map the primary cause of type diabetes is insulin resistance the loss of the ability to respond normally to insulin followed by the gradual destruction of the insulin secreting beta cells predisposition to diabetes is inherited and it is much more likely to occur in those who are obese but there is much more to be learned about this disease what are the genetic foundations of insulin resistance why is glucose so toxic to beta cells and what are the mechanisms involved in beta cell destruction what are the limitations of the beta cell regenerative capacity why does obesity cause insulin resistance a better understanding of these factors and how they interact over time to cause beta cell failure and permanent diabetes will lead to novel prevention strategies and new treatments present treatments for type diabetes remain unsatisfactory for a variety of reasons and as the incidence of this disease continues to rise concomitant with the prevalence of obesity improved therapy is greatly needed the genetics of diabetes promoting beta cell growth and regeneration in vivo and in cell culture how do diabetes genes act to cause insulin resistance and cell failure how does expanded adipose tissue cause insulin resistance the genetics of diabetes today scientists know little more than that there is an inherited component to the risk of getting diabetes and on the subsequent development of complications it appears that diabetes is caused by the combined action of many weakly acting genetic causes clearly variations in these genes must explain the predisposition to diabetes but the identification of the predisposing genes has until now been an insurmountable challenge the human genome project has provided a basic map of over of the dna comprising human chromosomes this map enables scientists to better understand the genetic basis for our differences in most cases very few differences are found when comparing the same gene between two different individuals when there are differences they tend to affect only one or a few of the basic building blocks of genes called nucleotides nevertheless since we have so many genes these few differences per gene add up to many thousands of variations in total dr david altshuler one of the world leaders in the quest to identify all of the common variations in genes has amassed a huge number of these gene variations taking a genomic approach he will compare the spectrum of these variants in very large numbers of individuals for which substantial medical information is available from this he will determine which genes are critical for the development of diabetes and its complications this information alone cannot tell us much about the role of individual genes however new technologies such as dna chips can be used determine where and when specific genes are expressed sophisticated computers analysis bioinformatics makes it possible to examine biological data on a large scale and to gather information about the specific changes that underlie the vast genetic diversity of the human population with this information coupled with the knowledge of the susceptibility or resistance to disease of many individuals it will be possible to make specific predictions about how complex gene combinations called genotypes are related to health or disease at the heart of this program is an understanding not only of what goes wrong in disease but also of the capacity of the human gene pool to withstand and avoid disease this genetic analysis is based on statistics comparing the variations present in individuals genes with the presence or absence of metabolic conditions such as diabetes only now can this be applied on a genomewide level and across an entire population yet similar analyses of candidate genes in large families have allowed scientists to make educated guesses about which particular genes might predispose some individuals to diabetes by forming and testing hypotheses in this way dr habeners laboratory recently linked some cases of type diabetes to mutations in the regulatory gene idx functional analysis of this gene demonstrated that it plays a role in beta cell development and insulin gene activation a genomic approach will yield information on many more genes that are linked to diabetes which will require subsequent functional analysis similar to that which dr habeners laboratory has done for idx many of these genes will undoubtedly play a role in the production of or the response to insulin once we know how the combination of individual genes relates to disease we will know who is at risk and we can advise those individuals on disease prevention we will know who is likely to succumb to complications of diabetes and thus who needs to pay extra special attention to controlling blood sugar levels we would like to use genetics to predict drug response and target medications to those who will benefit most by completing the full loop from the patient to the genotype and then back to the patient will we develop insights of direct benefit to the patient promoting beta cell growth and regeneration in vivo and in cell culture once the individual genes that regulate beta cell development insulin production and the response to insulin are identified and their function understood it will be possible to design drugs to target and manipulate them only then will it be possible to restore insulin production the number of insulin producing cells and insulin sensitivity in diabetic patients enabling their bodies to respond to and tightly control blood sugar levels in the same way as a healthy person dr melissa thomas is working towards this goal she studies the regulation of the insulin gene and of additional genes important for forming new beta cells and has recently discovered a novel coactivator of the insulin gene bridge that may function to boost insulin production in beta cells in the pancreas she has identified new functions for signaling by hedgehog proteins which were previously known to be important regulators in development demonstrating that they regulate production both of insulin and of idx a master regulator of beta cell development understanding how these regulatory proteins control insulin gene activity and the development of new beta cells is critical for designing new drugs to activate insulin production in response to rising blood sugar levels dr thomas also characterizes functional defects in pancreatic beta cells in transgenic mouse models that mimic diabetes in humans by examining altered patterns of gene expression in animal models of diabetes she is working to identify important signals that lead to beta cell failure with the goal of restoring beta cell function in patients with diabetes how do diabetes genes act to cause insulin resistance and cell failure a great deal of information is available describing the regulation of energy metabolism in man and the ways in which nutrient utilization is disturbed in the setting of insulin deficiency prediabetic insulin resistance and obesity the two primary sources of energy in the body are carbohydrate glucose and fat sources that are available at all times circulating in the blood stream after a meal any calories not immediately needed for energy are removed from the blood stream and stored ready to be summoned for utilization during the interval between meals the ability to store carbohydrate is limited and heavily dependent on effective insulin action whereas the capacity for fat storage is unlimited individuals with diabetes often have increased or decreased sensitivity to the effects of insulin particularly uptake and utilization of glucose by muscle and fat in individuals with type diabetes heightened insulin sensitivity can lead to poor control of their disease and low blood sugar in those with type diabetes decreased sensitivity insulin resistance frequently contributes not only to the development of diabetes itself but may also contribute to the development of diabetic complications it is therefore important to understand how insulin acts at the cellular and molecular level and to learn how this action is altered in diabetics only with such an understanding can we know exactly how to intervene with the goal of reversing the course of the disease or preventing it entirely dr joseph avruch has devoted his career to understanding the molecular components of the signaling cascade necessary for an effective insulin response within the cell binding of insulin to its receptor initiates a series of interactions among proteins and other molecules present within cells these interactions convey the information that insulin is present muscle and fat cells respond to this information in several ways by absorbing glucose and fat from the blood and storing them by growing or dividing and by secreting other hormones involved in controlling metabolism pancreatic beta cells also require many of these effects of insulin for optimal development and function of the pancreatic beta cell dr bogan is studying the mechanism by which muscle and fat cells to absorb glucose from the blood after insulin stimulation these cells move specialized glucose transporting proteins to their surfaces these glucose transporting proteins allow glucose to enter the cell from the bloodstream and to be metabolized or stored by the cells previous research to determine what specific proteins convey the insulin signal to cause movement of the glucose transporting proteins has employed conventional biochemical techniques based on binding of one protein to another this approach has resulted in some understanding of how insulin causes glucose utilization however it is sometimes difficult to identify the next protein in the cascade downstream of the insulin receptor another difficulty is that even once a new protein is identified it may turn out to be involved in one of insulins many actions other than glucose uptake dr bogan has developed a completely new method to study movement of glucose transporting proteins to and from the cell surface and to specifically identify proteins involved in insulinstimulated glucose uptake and utilization the power of this method is that it identifies proteins based on their function rather than by relying on conventional protein interaction techniques with this new technology he has already discovered two new proteins that elucidate previously unidentified and unexpected mechanism through which the glucose transporting proteins function further application of this new technology will identify many additional proteins involved in insulins ability to stimulate glucose utilization and will greatly accelerate our understanding of this important process and will identify potential targets for new drugs which could modulate the sensitivityresistance to insulin how does expanded adipose tissue cause insulin resistance in type diabetes the failure of insulin to regulate fatty acid release from fat cells results in elevated levels of circulating fat in the blood stream in addition the concentration of circulating fat is directly related to amount of fat tissue and as the levels of circulating fat increase glucose utilization is diminished the combination of these two factors is significant since the overwhelming majority of those with type diabetes are overweight or obese furthermore at least partly because glucose uptake into cells is impaired in diabetes fat metabolism is both increased and abnormal for example when fat is the sole energy source toxic metabolites known as ketone bodies are produced when fat is utilized for energy in addition the liver reacts to the high levels of circulating fat by converting excessive amounts of it to cholesterol dr tod gulicks work is focused on learning how fat metabolism is normally regulated and determining strategies to restore it to normal in diabetes in particular he is focusing on the mechanism by which fat is either converted to energy or stored that this mechanism may have gone awry in individuals with diabetes is highlighted by the fact that several currently used drugs for type diabetes interact with proteins controlling the fate of fat absorbed from the blood top copy massachusetts general hospitaldisclaimerprivacy policy site mapauc area under the curve mmtt mixedmeal tolerance test caffeine is a widely used drug despite evidence that it has deleterious consequences for health including diabetes in a study reported that drinking two cups of instant coffee significantly impaired glucose tolerance in a small group of men with maturityonset diabetes recent studies showed that caffeine acutely decreased insulin sensitivity in young nondiabetic adults this study tested how oral caffeine

he was the first pope to resign since gregory xii in and the first to do so on his own initiative since celestine v in papabiliedit the conclave cardinals may elect any baptised catholic male but since they have always elected a fellow cardinal observers of papal elections tend to consider a few cardinals more likely choices than the others these are the papabili the plural for papabile an italian word which is practically rendered into english as popeable inasmuch as the set of papabili is a matter of informed speculation the election of a nonpapabile is common recent cases are john xxiii in and john paul i and john paul ii both in christoph sch nborn of austria odilo scherer of brazil luis antonio tagle of the philippines peter turkson of ghana marc ouellet of canada p ter erd of hungary and angelo scola of italy were among the cardinals most often identified in press reports as those most likely to be elected francis arinze of nigeria and joseph zen of hong kong both over years old had also been named by the media as possible choices on march cardinal andr vingttrois said there were around half a dozen possible candidates the next day cardinal philippe barbarin said there are three four maybe a dozen candidates jorge bergoglio of argentina was seen as a papabile though less likely to emerge as pope one summary of likely candidates included him because he was the reported second place finisher at the last conclave but observed that his moment seems to be over speculationedit the los angeles times suggested that though a pope from latin america was unlikely with only of cardinalelectors being from latin america the region seeks more say in vatican affairs as it has the worlds largest catholic population it cited secularism and the rise of evangelicalism in latin america along with sex abuse scandals in mexico brazil and chile as issues important to the region bbc news said that while the balloting was likely to be hardfought between different factions for a european or a noneuropean an italian or a nonitalian future pope the internal differences were unclear and that many different priorities were at play making this election difficult to predict cardinal cormac murphyoconnor remarked laughingly to a bbc presenter that his colleagues have been telling him siamo confusi were confused as there were neither clear blocs nor a frontrunner one australian commentator noted that the reform of the administrative machinery of the church the roman curia was a major issue as there was no major progressive candidate and indeed no clear frontrunners in the dynamic between institutionalmaintenance and evangelical catholicism giacomo galeazzi of la stampa said that apparently a sort of tsunami of noneuropean candidates will fall upon the roman curia and this could take the pontificate far away from rome making it more international italian cardinal francesco coccopalmerio said its time to look outside italy and europe in particular considering latin america the dossier of the vaticans own internal investigation into the socalled vatileaks scandal was called in effect the th cardinal inside the conclave a although the investigating cardinals none of whom are cardinal electors are free to discuss the results of their investigation with the participants of the conclave the dossier itself is to be given by benedict xvi to his successor cardinal velasio de paolis cs said that the presence at the conclave of the former archbishop of los angeles roger mahony would be troubling but he also noted that the said cardinal has the right and duty to take part and the rules must be followed mahonys successor in los angeles archbishop jos horacio g mez had recently rebuked mahony for his handling of sex abuse cases though he supported mahonys presence at the conclave papal election processedit papal conclave of julius darmaatmadja indonesia keith obrien united kingdom pope emeritus benedict xvi new pope francis there were cardinals on the day the papacy fell vacant cardinals aged years or older before the day the papacy fell vacant are ineligible to participate leaving electors two of them were the first cardinalelectors from their churches to participate in a papal conclave maronite patriarch bechara boutros alrahid and syromalankara majorarchbishop baselios cleemis the first bishop from the syromalankara church to be created cardinal e two cardinal electors did not attend the conclave julius darmaatmadja from indonesia declined because of the progressive deterioration of his eyesight keith obrien the only potential cardinalelector from britainf had been recently accused of sexual misconduct towards priests in the s and said he did not want his presence to create a distraction he had resigned as archbishop of st andrews and edinburgh on february and later apologised for sexual misconduct preliminary discussions research and preparationsedit as soon as pope benedict announced his resignation cardinals began arriving in rome and by the day the interregnum formally began most of them had already arrived a formal invitation to the conclave was issued on march the last of the participating cardinal electors to arrive was cardinal jeanbaptiste ph m minh m n of ho chi minh city vietnam who arrived on march cardinal jorge mario bergoglio appears for the first time as pope francis on the balcony of st peters basilica march the two rounds of voting on the morning of the march proved inconclusive and black smoke was again sent outj scolas candidacy stalled going into wednesday and votes began to converge around the candidacies of ouellet and bergoglio sources report that at some point ouellet threw his support behind bergoglio and by the first afternoon ballotthe fourth ballot of the conclavebergoglio became the clear front runner on the fifth ballot the cardinals wishing to show a unified front voted overwhelmingly in favor of bergoglio reportedly giving him more than votes cardinal se n brady reported that applause broke out during the tabulation when bergoglios count reached the votes required for election when bergoglio was asked if he would accept his election according to cardinal wilfrid napier ofm he said although i am a sinner i accept he took the name francis in honour of st francis of assisi he later said that some cardinalelectors jokingly suggested he should choose either adrian after the great reformer pope adrian vi or clement after pope clement xiv who suppressed the jesuit order the portuguese section of vatican radio later would report that at the conclusion of the conclave archbishop lorenzo baldisseri the nonelector secretary of the conclave received the cardinalitial zucchetto from the newly elected pope traditionally if the conclave secretary was given the cardinalatial zucchetto it meant he would be elevated to the cardinalate in an upcoming consistory this was an old tradition that had last been practiced by pope john xxiii in when he placed his skullcap on the head of monsignor alberto di jorio who was secretary of the conclave creating him a cardinal formally in december of that yeark at local time white smoke announced that a pope had been chosen and shortly thereafter the vatican web site was changed to say habemus papam the cardinal protodeacon jeanlouis tauran appeared at the central balcony of st peters basilica and announced the election of the new pope and his chosen name pope francis appeared asked the people to bless him before he blessed the world at which point the conclave concluded postconclave eventsedit a half hour later the twitter account pontifex sent out a tweet that read habemus papam franciscum at pm local time the italian conference of bishops released a statement congratulating cardinal angelo scola of milan on his election as pope a corrected statement was released at pm as cardinals described the voting process carefully suppressing details so as not to violate their oath of secrecy one offered this assessment that scola might have won and is obviously qualified to be pope but there was a very strong bias against the italians he added there was a sense that the italians arent up to the job anymore they used to be so good but lately they seem to have lost control of things pope francis celebrated his inauguration on march and was installed as bishop of rome on april nsa surveillanceedit in october it was reported that the us national security agency had targeted cardinals in the conclave for surveillance including cardinal bergoglio an nsa

with a selfdeprecating sense of humor arinze has long been considered the leading african papabile he was made a bishop at just he grew up a member of the ibo tribe in nigeria and converted to catholicism at age in john paul ii appointed him head of the pontifical council for interreligious dialogue where he earned a reputation as one of the catholic churchs primary interlocutors with islam in he became the head of the congregation for divine worship giving him lead responsibility for liturgical practice while he earned high marks for diligence and openness in both positions he did not carve out a reputation as an original thinker on matters of faith and morals arinze is quite conservative jorge mario bergoglio argentina bergoglio a jesuit was a trained chemist before deciding to become a priest he is seen as an accomplished intellectual having studied theology in germany his leading role during the argentinean economic crisis in has burnished his reputation as a voice of conscience and has also made him a potent symbol of the costs globalization can impose on the third world within the jesuits bergoglios reputation is mixed he was appointed provincial in buenos aires in and at a time when many latin american jesuits were moving into the social apostolate he insisted on a more traditional spiritual approach bergoglio is today close to the comunione e liberazione movement he comes across as traditional theologically but open and compassionate dario castrill n hoyos colombia currently head of the vatican office for clergy castrill n hoyos served as secretary general of celam the latin american bishops conference from to giving him a wide network of contacts across the continent as a pastor in colombia castrill n hoyos earned high marks for defense of the poor including his willingness to challenge the countrys notorious drug barons he is traditional doctrinally he was a fierce opponent of liberation theology an effort among progressive latin american catholics to place the church on the side of progressive social movements castrill n has been elegized by one of the th centurys foremost novelists colombian gabriel garc a m rquez who described him as this rustic man with the profile of an eagle castrill n alienated some americans during the sexual abuse crisis of it fell to him to present the popes first public statement on the crisis during a march news conference and he came off as defensive and combative broadly hinting that the situation was an american problem godfried danneels belgium a former professor of liturgy at the catholic university of louvain danneels has a reputation as both an intellectual and a pastor in he turned the pessimistic tide that had dominated the early going at the synod on europe by insisting there is much of value in contemporary western culture at a special consistory in danneels said bluntly that the church must become more collegial he also ran the bestorganized media operation holding a series of news conferences for different language groups at the belgian college he is open to appointing women to run curial agencies yet danneels is no radical in early he did not hesitate to suspend fr rudi borremans a belgian priest who announced he was homosexual and then concelebrated a mass in violation of danneels orders one question mark about danneels is his health in late he had a serious heart attack julius darmaatmadja indonesia another jesuit darmaatmadja enjoys a reputation as a humble spiritual man he served as jesuit provincial of indonesia before being named a bishop and since has become the president of the indonesia bishops conference as the primary spokesperson for the catholic church in the worlds largest muslim nation darmaatmadja is a key point of reference for the global christianmuslim dialogue he has rejected the identification of islam with terrorism called upon christians to forgive islamic radicals behind church bombings in and was an outspoken critic of the usled war in iraq for these reasons he has wide credibility in the islamic community while darmaatmadja enjoys respect for sincerity integrity and pastoral instinct some question whether he has

carrera mexico oscar andr s rodr guez maradiaga honduras christoph sch nborn austriaangelo scola italy dionigi tettamanzi italy a black south african napier would symbolize the churchs transition to the third world he is well trained theologically having studied at the catholic university of louvain in belgium his humble franciscan spirituality is appealing as is his advocacy of social justice he grew up on a south african farm with seven brothers and sisters under the countrys apartheid regime in napier opposed a papal visit to south africa on the grounds that it would legitimize the whitedominated government some percent of the million catholics in south africa have black skin he said and they suffer terrible repression by the very security forces that during an eventual visit would have to escort the pope local observers note however that napier was not among the vanguard of the antiapartheid movement inside the church napier has spoken strongly on collegiality at the extraordinary consistory in may he criticized a vatican attempt to retake control of liturgical decisions from local bishops yet he is also seen as safe on doctrinal questions and has been a vigorous opponent of abortion jaime lucas ortega y alamino cuba ortega the archbishop of havana since has earned respect for his cautious defiance of cubas communist regime he is seen as a deft conciliator between the notoriously divided cuban exile community and cubans who stayed behind after the communist revolution he spent in one of castros labor camps during a period of national history cuban catholics call the silencing of god on most church questions he hews very closely to the vatican line he has said that he feels very close to the pontificate of john paul ii like john paul ortega y alamino has urged his nation not to construct a postcommunist future on the basis of hypercapitalist principles in he warned of the insidious influence in cuba of a species of american subculture that invades everything it is a fashion a conception of life marc ouellet canada as archbishop of quebec city ouellet represents francophone canada the former secretary of the pontifical council for promoting christian unity ouellet is well regarded in rome and across much of the international catholic hierarchy he is associated with the communio school a theological journal founded by moderatetoconservatives disappointed with some of the excesses that followed the second vatican council and is a devotee of swiss catholic theologican hans urs von balthasar a darling of the catholic right in some ways he is a traditionalist and has advocated a return to eucharistic adoration and gregorian chant suggesting that quebecs s quiet revolution marked too radical a change yet people who have worked with ouellet describe him as friendly humble and flexible and a man not so captive to his own intellectual system as to make him incapable of listening to others he is fluent in english french italian and german giovanni battista re italy re served for years as sostituto the official in the secretariat of state responsible for the daytoday management of church affairs the job has often been a springboard to higher office giovanni battista montini for example was the sostituto under pius xii before becoming paul vi re has not shrunk from the role of curial enforcer when an italian priest took part in a progay rally in rome in july re phoned his bishop to demand disciplinary action he also refused permission for bishop mpm muskens of holland to hold a diocesan synod fearing that the liberal prelate might let things get out of hand yet re is generally considered a moderate and has given signals of support for decentralization when scotlands late cardinal thomas winning needed support in for an appeal against the congregation for worship and its attempts to take control away from bishops conferences on liturgical issues he got a sympathetic ear from re he is a legendary hard worker often returning calls from his office late on sunday nights and has an encyclopedic grasp of the inner workings of the vatican if the cardinals are looking for an insider who could reform the curia re could be their man norberto rivera carrera mexico like many other latin american churchmen rivera carrera is a strong advocate of social justice his criticism of globalization and political corruption so annoyed mexicos salinas government that it threatened to adopt a law forbidding priests from commenting on politics rivera carerra is strong willed and knows how to handle himself in a fight for example he won a showdown with a famous abbot who ran the basilica of our lady of guadalupe who had publicly questioned the historical truth of marys appearance to juan diego although the abbot had been appointed for life by john xxiii rivera carrera succeeded in forcing him to resign the cardinal is a conservative on virtually all church matters in as bishop of tehuac he closed a seminary that he charged was teaching marxist theology he is also close to the legionaries of christ one of the new rightwing movements in the life of the church that sprung up

church sch nborn comes from an aristocratic background some members of his family have over the centuries been archbishops bishops or priests as cardinal he won high marks in his first few months in austria where the church had been rocked by a sexual misconduct scandal involving his predecessor as time went on however sch nborn committed a series of administrative missteps these gaffes combined with sch nborns youth and his reputation as rigid in his theological views tarnished his reputation though he remains popular abroad angelo scola italy the patriarch of venice scola is the first

evangelium vitae he is close to the conservative catholic organization opus dei in on the groups th anniversary tettamanzi published an article praising founder jos maria escriv de balaguer as comparable to ss benedict and francis of assisi in terms of launching new movements within the church tettamanzi burnished his credentials with traditionalists by writing letters in support of indulgences and church teaching on the devil at the same time he added luster to his standing with social justice activists by his performance during the g summit in genoa in july he embraced much of the antiglobalization protest delivering a rousing address at a meeting of thousands of young catholics in which he insisted that a single african child sick with aids counts more than the entire

scholar with a modern touch ndash just the combination some faithful see as ideal for reviving a church beset by scandal and a shrinking flock the yearold is also one of the favorites among catholics who long to see a return to the tradition of italian popes the polyglot biblical scholar peppers speeches with references ranging from aristotle to late british diva amy winehouse ravasis foreign language prowess is reminiscent of that of the late globetrotting john paul ii he tweets in english chats in italian and has impressed his audiences by switching to hebrew and arabic in some of his speeches cardinal peter turkson often cast as the social conscience of the church ghanas turkson is viewed by many as the top african contender for pope the yearold head of the vaticans peace and justice office was widely credited with helping to avert violence following contested ghanaian elections he has aggressively fought african poverty while disappointing many by hewing to the churchs conservative line on condom use amid africas aids epidemic turksons reputation as a man of peace took a hit recently when he showed a virulently antiislamic video a move now seen as hurting his papal prospects observers say those prospects sank further when he broke a taboo against public jockeying for the papacy ndash saying the day after benedicts resignation announcement that hes up for the job if its the will of god cardinal timothy dolan dolan the yearold archbishop of new york is an upbeat affable defender of catholic orthodoxy and a wellknown religious figure in the united states he holds a job pope john paul ii once called archbishop of the capital of the world his colleagues broke with protocol in and made him president of the us conference of catholic bishops instead of elevating the sitting vice president as expected and during the presidential election republicans and democrats competed over which national political convention the cardinal would bless he did both but scholars question whether his charisma and experience are enough for a real shot at succeeding benedict cardinal jorge mario bergoglio bergoglio has spent nearly his entire career at home in argentina overseeing churches and shoeleather priests the archbishop of buenos aires reportedly got the secondmost votes after joseph ratzinger in the papal election and he has long specialized in the kind of pastoral work that some say is an essential skill for the next pope in a lifetime of teaching and leading priests in latin america which has the largest share of the worlds catholics bergoglio has shown a keen political sensibility as well as the kind of selfeffacing humility that fellow cardinals value highly bergoglio is known for modernizing an argentine church that had been among the most conservative in latin america cardinal leonardo sandri leonardo sandri is a vatican insider who has run the daytoday operations of the global churchs vast bureaucracy and roamed the world as a papal diplomat he left his native argentina for rome at and never returned to live in his homeland initially trained as a canon lawyer he reached the no spot in the churchs hierarchy under pope john paul ii the zenith of a long career in the vaticans diplomatic service ranging from africa to mexico to washington as substitute secretary of state for seven years he essentially served as the popes chief of staff the jovial diplomat has been knighted in a dozen countries and the church he is attached to as cardinal is romes exquisite baroque san carlo ai catinari cardinal luis antonio tagle asias most prominent roman catholic leader knows how to reach the masses he sings on stage preaches on tv brings churchgoers to laughter and tears with his homilies and hes on facebook but the yearold filipinos best response against the tide of secularism clergy sex abuse scandals and rivalfaith competition could be his reputation for humility his compassion for the poor and unassuming ways have impressed followers in his homeland asias largest catholic nation and church leaders in the vatican tagles chances are considered remote as many believe that latin america or africa ndash with their fastergrowing catholic flocks ndash would be more logical choices if the papal electors look beyond europe cardinal christoph schoenborn schoenborn is a softspoken conservative who is ready to listen to those espousing reform that profile could appeal to fellow cardinals looking to elect a pontiff with the widestpossible appeal to the worlds billion catholics his austrian nationality may be his biggest disadvantage electors may be reluctant to choose another german speaker as a successor to benedict a man of low tolerance for the child abuse scandals roiling the church schoenborn himself was elevated to the upper echelons of the catholic hierarchy after his predecessor resigned years ago over accusations that he was a pedophile cardinal malcolm ranjith benedict xvi picked the sri lankan ranjith to return from colombo to the vatican to oversee the churchs liturgy and rites in one of his first appointments as pope the choice of ranjith in rewarded a strong voice of tradition ndash so rigid that some critics regard it even as backwardlooking ranjith in was named sri lankas second cardinal in history there are many strikes against a ranjith candidacy ndash sri lanka for example has just million catholics less than half the population of rome but the rising influence of the developing world along with the yearolds strong conservative credentials helps keep his name in the mix of papal contenders cardinal andres rodriguez maradiaga to many maradiaga embodies the activist wing of the roman catholic church as an outspoken campaigner of human rights a watchdog on climate change and advocate of international debt relief for poor nations others however see the yearold honduran as a reactionary in the other direction described as sympathetic to a coup in his homeland and stirring accusations of antisemitism for remarks that some believe suggested jewish interests encouraged extra media attention on church sex abuse scandals maradiaga the archbishop of tegucigalpa is among a handful of latin american prelates considered to have a credible shot at the papacy cardinal angelo bagnasco the archbishop of genoa bagnasco also is head of the powerful italian bishops conference both roles give him outsized influence in the conclave where italians represent the biggest national bloc and could nudge ahead his papal chances if the conclave looks to return the papacy to italian hands at years old bagnasco is seen as in the right age bracket for papal consideration but his lack of international experience and exposure could be a major liability cardinal sean patrick omalley as archbishop of boston omalley has faced the fallout from the churchs abuse scandals for nearly a decade the fact he is mentioned at all as a potential papal candidate is testament to his efforts to bring together an archdiocese at the forefront of the abuse disclosures like other american cardinals the papal prospects for the yearold omalley suffer because of the accepted belief that many papal electors oppose the risk of having us global policies spill over even indirectly onto the vaticans image omalley is among the most internetsavvy members of the conclave michael

neither worker was hurt the sinkhole has expanded to the size of a football field cnn two workers were rescued thursday after at least feet of earth collapsed into a sinkhole that appeared nearly two weeks ago in assumption parish louisiana officials said the workers were on a boat that was tied to a tree when the land gave way trapping them on the vessel police spokeswoman kim torres told cnn in a telephone interview an airboat rescued them soon after neither worker was hurt she said in a statement the company doing work on the site said the workers escaped from the sinkhole which widened more feet thursday and is as big as a football field sinkhole expected to keep residents away at least a month sinkhole tested for radioactivity but the houstonbased texas brine company which owns the property about an hours drive west of new orleans said the workers sailed on the airboat away from the affected area before the collapse the situation is all the more worrisome because the hole is believed to be close to a well containing million barrels of butane a volatile liquid that turns into a flammable vapor upon release about households have been evacuated a state official said the widening of the sinkhole was no surprise it has been predicted by experts and has been gradually occurring since it first formed said texas brine in a statement torres said the two workers are employed by clean harbors which describes itself as the leading provider of environmental energy and industrial services and the largest hazardous waste disposal company in north america texas brine spokesman sonny cranch said the workers were removing debris floating in the sinkhole when at least one person aboard a rescue boat saw the land fall in and immediately moved to a safer area which happened to be a nearby airboat authorities were investigating the cause of the hole which has swallowed cypress trees up to feet tall the company has said that a nearby salt cavern could be to blame

it might well be that bill nye has explained fully about the meteorite that showered a russian city but others have darker explanations yes of course it has a source in the military you thought it didnt though ive watched a few movies in which exciting things happen i dont find it easy to imagine that some sort of terrestrially created missileladen aircraft could really explode a meteorite in such a manner it is easier to imagine though that politicians like zhirinovsky might take the opportunity to foment a little rage indeed alex jones infamously wellguarded infowars site offered that zhirinovsky insisted that america in the person of secretary of state john kerry had tried to give russia advance notice of its attack the drudge report led me to a piece at foreign policy that explained that sergey lavrov russias foreign minister simply hadnt called kerry back which all suggests that russia isnt after all living in fear of an attack from the us especially one over chelyabinsk on balance i prefer to currently believe nye he is the science guy after all and science guys know scientific events when they see them i hopewithin minutes of the meteor s impact alternative theories began to circulate that the object seen in the video had been shot down by russian air defence missiles to prevent further destruction the theory seems to have stemmed from a report from the local znak newspaper which quoted an anonymous military source who claimed that the object was intercepted by an air defense unit at the urzhumka settlement near chelyabinsk according to the source a missile salvo blew the meteorite apart at an altitude of kilometers scattering burning debris over the region russia today picked up the report and sent it viral on the internet adding that regnum news agency quoted a military source who claimed that the vapor condensation trail of the meteorite speaks to the fact that the meteorite was intercepted by air defenses in the hours that have passed the story has been tweeted and retweeted thousands of times the russian regional emergency ministry has denied that any military air defenses were involved in the incident witnesses in a town kilometers from chelyabinsk where the meteor is thought to have hit said they saw a streaking object suddenly burst into flames break apart and fall to the ground they then described a black cloud had hanging above the town witnesses in chelyabinsk itself said that the air smelled like gunpowder after the object hit reactions to the shoot down theory have been mixed with detractors suggesting no upward missile vapour trail or intercepting object can be seen in the videos and that it would be impossible to shoot down an object travelling with such speed at the trajectory it approached more wide eyed theorists have suggested that the object may not have been a meteor at all and could have been a satellite that was shot down or some form of kinetic bombardment weapon aimed at russia the latter theory seems to have stemmed from comments made by russian nationalist lawmaker vladimir zhirinovsky who claimed that the flashes and sonic booms witnessed were the results of a secret us weapons test zhirinovsky known for making such startling claims about advanced weaponry suggested that he had advance knowledge of a test he also claimed that us secretary of state john kerry had attempted to warn russian foreign minister sergei lavrov about a coming provocation earlier this week but couldnt reach him it seems more likely however that the provocation kerry had spent time trying to speak to lavrov about by phone was in refernce to the recent nuclear test in north korea steve watson is the london based writer and editor for alex jones infowarscom and

Query:Shahbag protest
Page:in bangladesh was the portion of the islamic republic of pakistan known as east pakistan in the liberation war of bangladesh east pakistan fought west pakistan for nine months during this period the indian army which provided guerrilla training to freedom fighters of mukti bahini joined the war on december in support of the liberation of east pakistan armed conflict ended on december through surrender of the pakistani armed forces to india resulting in the formation of the peoples republic of bangladesh as a free secular and independent state according to the famous blood telegram from the united states consulate in dacca to the state department many atrocities had been committed by the pakistan army and its supporter razakars and albadar militia time reported a highranking us official as saying it is the most incredible calculated killing since the days of the nazis in poland estimates are that one to three million people were killed nearly a quarter of a million women were raped and more than ten million people fled to india to escape persecution a paramilitary force known as the razakars was created by the may razakar ordinance promulgated by tikka khan the governor of east pakistan the ordinance stipulated the creation of a volunteer force trained and equipped by the provincial government razakar bengali comes from raz k r the urdu word for volunteer however it became a derogatory term in the bengali language due to the widespread killings of civilians and atrocities committed by the paramilitary during the war the war criminals mostly young men were never brought to trial since bangladesh needed to bargain with pakistan for the return of bengalis stranded in pakistan at the end of the warcitation needed the majority of east pakistanis supported the call to create a free and independent bangladesh during the liberation war a small number of pakistani supporters and members of fundamentalist political parties particularly jamaateislami jei and its student wing islami chatra sangha ics bengali islami chhatro sh nggho the muslim league the pakistan democratic party pdp council and nejameislami collaborated with the pakistani army to resist the formation of an independent bangladesh the students belonging to islami chatra sangha were known as the albadr force people belonging to jamaateislami muslim league

right after the verdict was announced student organisations started the protest immediately after the judgement in the shahbag square that was the actual call for people to gather in the shahbag square within half an hour of the judgement it took half an hour to spread out the call for protest through different social media and later the satellite tv channels boan and some other social and cultural organisations called for different programmes in the same venue who later worked together demonstrators gathered at shahbag circle or projonmo chottor they painted murals on the road drew

protest began at the busy shahbag intersection in dhaka bangladesh on the th of february on that day the international crimes tribunal had sentenced abdul quader mollah a leader of the islamist jamaateislami opposition party the country s largest islamist party to life in prison for his crimes against humanity committed during the bangladesh liberation war during the war many of the current jamaateislami leaders and members collaborated with pakistan and fought against creating the independent bangladesh these islamists were involved in a brutal campaign to quell the nationalist uprising their atrocities included widespread rape systemic killings and a targeted push against bangladeshi intellectuals pakistan was defeated and bangladesh gained independence but all these years after the war the islamist party remains a important fixture in national politics with vast lucrative business interests the life prison sentence led to widespread discontent in the country and a protest started at shahbag intersection demanding changing the court verdict to capital punishment for mollah online activists and bloggers supported the first outburst of the protest and called for a mass support for the demonstration and that day thousands people joined the protest site at shahbag intersection the movement quickly spread to other parts of bangladesh and the demands were widened to capital punishment for all convicted of war crimes and banning the jamaateislami party from politics protesters also called to boycott and delegalise institutions and businesses supporting or affiliated with the party since the beginning of protests thousands of people were holding hour vigils at shahbag day and night chanting slogans singing songs staging performances and burning candles they said they refused to leave until all their demands were met and those convicted of war crimes would be going to be executed the demonstration put pressure on the government and on the th of february the international crimes tribunal act was amended so that convicted war criminals could be swiftly executed if convicted also a bill was being drafted to ban jamaateislami from bangladeshi politics however it was only a beginning of a story that is still developing in bangladesh and the political situation in the country is very difficult the jamaateislami is fighting for its political

sushma swaraj meets bangladesh nationalist party chief khaleda zia tweetshahbagh what revolution whose revolution william gomes february the protests in shahbagh errupted apparently spontaneously in response to the first verdict handed down by bangladeshs domestic tribunal for war crimes committed during the war of independence in the primary demand the death sentence in the jamaateislami jamaat was banned from politics soon after bangladeshs liberation by the first president of bangladesh sheikh mujibur rahman now the daughter of mujibur rahman prime minister sheikh hasina is planning to ban jamaat again in response to the demands raised by the shahbag movement which began on th february jamaat was banned from politics by mujib for its alleged involvement in war crimes in in jamaat was allowed to take part in politics through the enactment of the political party regulation ppr by president ziaur rahman in after years thousands of people went down into the road demanding the banning of jamaat from politics the shahbag protest has spread to other parts of the country with sitins and demonstrations taking place in chittagong sylhet barisal mymensingh khulna rajbari rajshahi rangpur sunamganj noakhali and narsingdi and bangladeshis in different parts of the world expressing their solidarity for the movement the shahbag movement has been widely reported positively by local and international media but selected media outlets that support opposition political parties have continued to denounce the shahbag movement as a wellorchestrated play made by the government people in bangladesh remain politically polarized between supporting and opposing the shahbag movement and its demands a straw man on february abdul latif siddiqui the jute and textiles minister of the government confirmed to media that the preparation of a draft bill banning jamaateislami from bangladeshi politics is underway journalists asked mahbubul alam hanif special assistant to the pm why the government did not take the initiative to ban jamaat before why the government is taking that initiative after demands from the shahabg movement hanif answered that the government was looking for peoples support before taking any major decision like this but many people who oppose the shahbag movement repeatedly stress that it is the other way round the government is trying to create antijamaat sentiment by bringing forward this shahbag movement people involved as organizers of the movement have publicly denied this allegation they have repeatedly said that they are a nonpolitical movement and are in the road with specific demands capital punishment for abdul quader mollah as well as for all war criminals the banning of jamaateislami from bangladeshi from politics and the boycott of all educational and economic institutions run by jamaateislami bangladesh on february a protester and blogger named ahmed rajib haider who had actively participated in the shahbagh protest from the beginning was killed people involved with the shahbagh movement claimed that rajib was killed by the student wing of jamaateislami chhatra shibir jamaat have publicly denied their involvement in rajibs murder the major opposition media outlets daily amar desh and daily nayadiganta published a series of stories quoting different blog post of rajib and other people involved in shahbag movement and tilted them as anti islamic and atheist the shahbag movement now faces violent counterprotest called by different islamic parties in the country these series of events raise many questions about the role of and reasons for the shahbag movement at the same time it also raises questions about the role of the main opposition party and islamic parties and their reactionary counter shahbagh movement just and spontaneous demands the major demand of the movement is to ban jamaat from politics the first question then is why should the government ban jamaat from politics people who are in favor of the shahbag movement counter the question by saying that jamaat opposed bangladeshs independence and collaborated with the pakistani army during so they have no rights to do politics in a free bangladesh jamaat and its supporters have repeatedly denied jamaats and their leaders involvement in war crimes and claim that the war crimes charges brought against the party leaders in bangladeshs notorious international crimes tribunal are politically motivated false cases many common people ask why the awami government needed years to identify jamaat as a party and their leaders as individuals as war criminals in the recent past the awami league even allied with jamaat against president ershad this raises the next question what made the awami league move to ban the political party previously their allies now an electoral tipping point the answer is quite simple the awami league will benefit greatly from the ban in the forthcoming general election jamaat is a big challenge for the awami league because of its growing popularity and its close alliance with the bangladesh nationalist party it is in the air that the awami league has planned to ban jamaat before the next general election in order to clear the path and make the electoral battle easy in the last general election held in jamaat was part of a four party alliance jamaat contested in seats and won only two which is of the total the main ally of jamaat in the alliance the bangladesh nationalist party bnp contested in seats and won which is of the total the winning alliance led by the awami league won seats which is of the total its main ally the jatiya party won seats which is the other parties in the coalition are much smaller jatiyo samajtantrik dal won seats which is the workers party of bangladesh won seats which is out of total and the liberal democratic party won seat which is out of total the jatiya party have declared they will contest separately in the next general election this has left the awami league to fight the election with some small less popular political parties in addition the awami league government has lost much public support due to the mass corruption and poor performance of the government the jatiya partys strategic move weakens the position of the awami league and strengthens the bnp jamaats record electoral success was in when they won seats polls have suggested that jamaat may break this record in the next election if jamaat gains more votes than the awami leagues allies in the ruling coalition at the next election it would change the whole political landscape perhaps resulting in a win for bnp and bringing down the present government in jamaat played a vital role in antigovernment protest along side of bnp if jamaat is banned from politics before the next general election not only would it alter coalition politics but the bnp itself would be weakened with a less effective campaign and fewer seats so should jamaat be banned jamaat has participated in many parliamentary elections since alongside many other democratic parties and following due democratic process in the general election jamaat won seats voter turnout was out of which jamaat gained votes out of the total in jamaat won seats voter turnout was jamaat got votes which is of the total vote in jamaat won seats voter turnout was the second highest to date jamaat got votes or in jamaat won seats voter turnout was jamaat got votes or in turnout was the highest in the history of bangladeshi elections jamaat got votes which is out of total and entailed two seats this continuous participation in almost all of bangladeshs general elections and the numbers of votes cast in favor of jamaat shows that they have citizens in the country who support them given this whether to ban jamaat from politics should be widely discussed among bangladeshs citizens not to do so ignores and excludes those citizens voting in favor of jamaat jamaats control of institutions the second demand is to boycott the different institutions controlled by jammat these include financial and educational institutions and media outlets jamaat isnt the only political party to have influence in bangladeshs economy the leaders of different political parties have their own businesses notably much of the media is owned by members of the ruling party however jamaat indirectly owns and controls these institutions and their supporters get priority in terms of employment but why is it amongst the list of demands at shahbagh and who will benefit from such a boycott over years jamaat as an institution has became financially very strong in contrast the awami league in spite of ruling the country mainly depends on donations from different financial institutions and persons it has been alleged that the awami leagues manner of collecting donations is forceful even a type of extortion in an extortion case was in fact filed against sheikh hasina leader of the awami league and current prime minister while the awami league depends on direct fundraising of this kind jamaat as an institution has emerged as a powerful economic force a shadow government jamaat has developed its presence in almost all sectors from banking education health care and the media to industry and trade such as food drugs and pharmaceuticals garments and textiles paper leather cement iron and steel lets take a close look at the jamaat banking institution islami bank bangladesh ltd ibbl this is the largest private banking network in bangladesh with million in authorized capital and million in paidup capital it has million in deposits and a million investment including investment in shares after the boycott call government supporters set fire to ibbl and jamaat educational institutions the offices of the daily amar desh and nayadigant daily sangram diganta tv all of which are well know as proopposition newspapers and channels were attacked in different parts of the country if people keep boycotting the bank there will be a gap and the close competitors of the bank will be the benefactors in terms of the consumer and investment banking market it is not clear who would emerge to fill the gap however in terms of jamaats political competitors there is a clear beneficiary it is believed that the political activities and activists of jamaat are financially supported by their economic activities such as ibbl by boycotting or destroying the different institutions of jamaat the government is trying to break the financial backbone of jamaat is there a case to single out jamaat there may be cause for concern that a political party like jamaat should have so much economic power but then why isnt the shahbagh movement demanding the boycott of the largest stateowned commercial bank sonali bank limited sonali bank limited is responsible for illegally disbursing a loan of tk bn usd bn some have said that the shahbagh movement should widen their demands to include other issues such as the endless corrupt practices of different government institutions but organisers of the shahbagh protests have said that this movement is solely for the demands already stated and so we turn to the final demand the execution of jamaat leader abdul quader mollah and all other war criminals this demand forms the centre of the case for singling out jamaat judges should give verdicts based on evidence presented in court and not simply in response to street pressure the demand is contrary to the rule of law the effects of shahbagh moving their attention away from jamaat slightly the shahbag movement has also demanded the boycott of several major newspapers and television channels the daily amar desh daily nayadiganta diganta television and islamic tv all these media groups are known as proopposition news media if it is a social movement not directed by a political party why do the shahbag protestors demand the boycott of these media producers specifically and who will benefit from the boycott again the answer is clear freedom of expression and media is a precondition of and essential for democracy the beneficiares of the boycott are therefore not interested in democracy the awami league government has already closed channel one the channel went off air on april the channels founder giasuddin al mamun is known to be a close associate of bnp chief khaleda zias son tarique rahman the last caretaker government shut down csb news bangladeshs first hour news and current affairs channel in september csb news was initiative of salahuddin quader chowdhury who is a member of the standing committee of bangladesh nationalist party apart from the daily amar desh daily nayadiganta diganta television and islamic tv most media in the country is owned by the supporters of the awami league for example desh tv is owned by awami mp saber hossain chowdhury somoy tv is owned by qamrul islam state minister for law gazi tv is owned by awami mp gazi the ironically named independent tv is owned by businessman and awami supporter salam f rahman and mohona tv is owned by awami mp kamal majumder media shapes our country today and tomorrow it shapes how people will think how they will act and of course how they vote the coverage of shahbag by progovernment media is playing a vital role in shaping bangladesh the future may hold an even greater stranglehold over bangladeshi politics and economics the ruling awami league government is trying to override the existing political system to remain in power beyond their democratic mandate the purposive actions and structural forces behind this movement make it very clear what and who the movement is for the ruling political elite the shahbag movement was never a peoples movement but has been designed to disrupt the processes of social revolution by uprooting the governments political opponents from the field to avoid a political revolution at the next election this

jaylveck earth ndash see all my reviews i am so surprised that people donx t appreciate the beauty and awe of this picture then again should i be surprised that people every day in all aspects of society tear down beautiful things like forests and architecture no because it happens all the time i took my daughter to this and we watched it in d i was not much in the mood for a movie and i really had no idea what to expect i thought this movie was brilliant and it truly took me to another place i was glued to the screen and couldnx t take my eyes off it was so good all the way throughyes i have read the complaints from critics who are all failed artists in my opinion knocking it for everything from james francox s performance which i thought was brilliant and inspiring to a thin storyline etc blah blah blahall i can say is you critics are so busy overanalyzing every little detail you learned in some acting class somewhere that you missed the point of the movie just sit there and enjoy it this is true creativity you have lost your sense of childlike wonderment about the world none of you would ever be able to accomplish something like thismy daughter and i both loved it i think raimix s vision was well executed and the cast and crew did a great job i think itx s better than the original oz movie is it sacrilegious to say thatthe d was the best d yet way better than avatar in the d department this film is a masterpiece of color it was beyond beautiful it was so beautifulthe actresses have never looked better either franco was cool in the real sense and he looked like it this movie was perfectly made and i felt like i was there in a cynical world where art seems to be less and less appreciated i cannot help but stand up and say i loved it amidst all the

from film critics the film holds a approval rating on aggregate review site rotten tomatoes with an average score of based on reviews the sites consensus says it suffers from some tonal inconsistency and a deflated sense of wonder but oz the great and powerful still packs enough visual dazzle and clever wit to be entertaining in its own right the film holds a score of out of on metacritic based on reviews indicating mixed to average reviews kim newman writing for empire gave the film out of stars and said if there are postharry potter children who dont know or care about the wizard of oz they might be at sea with this story about a notverynice grownup in a magic land but longterm oz watchers will be enchanted and enthralled mila kunis gets a gold star for excellence in bewitchery and sam raimi can settle securely behind the curtain as a mature master of illusion critic alonso duralde also admired the movie that oz the great and powerful is so thoroughly effective both on its own terms and as a prequel to one of the most beloved movies ever made indicates that this team has magic to match any witch or wizard leonard maltin on indiewire claimed that no movie ever can or will replace s the wizard of oz but taken on its own terms this eyefilling fantasy is an entertaining riff on how the wizard of that immortal film found his way to oz ign rated the film and said the film is expansive and largerthanlife in scope and so are the performances overall franco in particular hams it up and is often playing to the balconythe d is utilized just as it should be in a childrens fantasy epic such as this overtly but with skill snowflakes music boxes and mysterious animals all leap through the screen towards the audience as the story unfolds justin chang of variety had a mixed reaction writing that the film gets some mileage out of its game performances luscious production design and the unfettered enthusiasm director sam raimi brings to a thin simplistic origin story he also compared the films scale with the star wars prequel trilogy adding in a real sense oz the great and powerful has a certain kinship with george lucas star wars prequels in the way it presents a beautiful but borderlinesterile digital update of a world that was richer purer and a lot more fun in lowertech form here too the actors often look artificially superimposed against their cg backdrops though the intensity of the fakery generates its own visual fascination film rated the film out of saying it had many charms while considering it to be basically army of darkness normal guy lands in magical land is forced to go on quest to save that land but just when you see raimis kinetic signature style starting to unleash the story forces the film back into its disney shell to play to the masses were left with a film thats entertaining a little scarier than youd expect but extremely inconsistent richard roeper writing for roger ebert noted the films omnipresent visual effects but was largely disappointed by the performance of some cast members to see williams so bland and sugary as glinda and kunis so flat and ineffectual as the heartsick theodora marshall fine of the huffington post was unimpressed writing oh its exciting enough for a sixyearold anyone older however will already have been exposed to so much on tv at the movies and on the internet that this will seem like so much visual cottoncandy even a sophisticated gradeschooler will find these doings weak and overblown similarly todd mccarthy criticized the characterization writing that the films supporting cast cant begin to compare with their equivalents in the original so the burden rests entirely upon franco and williams whose dialogue exchanges are repetitive and feel tentative entertainment weekly agreed giving the film a c and saying that the miscast franco lacks the humor charm and geewhiz wonder were meant to feel as he trades wisecracks with a flying monkey and soars above a field of poppies in a giant soap bubble if hes not enchanted how are we supposed to be and complaining that while raimis oz is like retinal crack he never seduces our hearts and minds alisha coelho of incom gave the movie

enewsletters other languages investopedia sweden copy investopedia us a division of iac all rights reserved terms of use privacy policyan introduction to dark pools by elvis picardo cfa a a a dark pools are an ominoussounding term for private exchanges or forums for trading securities unlike stock exchanges dark pools are not accessible by the investing public also known as dark pools of liquidity they are so named for their complete lack of transparency dark pools came about primarily to facilitate block trading by institutional investors who did not wish to impact the markets with their large orders and consequently obtain adverse prices for their trades while dark pools have been cast in a very unfavorable light in michael lewis bestseller flash boys a wall street revolt the reality is that they do serve a purpose however their lack of transparency makes them vulnerable to potential conflicts of interest by their owners and predatory trading practices by some highfrequency traders see also how iex is combating predatory types of highfrequency tradesrationale for dark pools the current controversy surrounding dark pools may lead one to think that they are a recent innovation but they have actually been around since the late s nonexchange trading in the us has surged in recent years accounting for about of all us stock trades in compared with six years ago dark pools have been at the forefront of this trend towards offexchange trading accounting for of us volume as of according to figures given by industry insiderswhy did dark pools come into existence consider the options available to a large institutional investor who wanted to sell million shares of xyz stock prior to the advent of nonexchange trading this investor could either a work the order through a floor trader over the course of a day or two and hope for a decent vwap volume weighted average price b split the order up into say five pieces and sell shares per day or c sell small amounts until a large buyer could be found who was willing to take up the full amount of the remaining shares the market impact of a million sale of xyz shares could still be sizeable regardless of whether the investor chose a b or c since it was not possible to keep the identity or intention of the investor secret in a stock exchange transaction with options b and c the risk of a decline in the period while the investor was waiting to sell the remaining shares was also significant dark pools were one solution to these issueswhy use a dark poolcontrast this with the presentday situation in which an institutional investor uses a dark pool to sell a million share block the lack of transparency actually works in the institutional investors favor since it may result in a better realized price than if the sale was executed on an exchange note that as dark pool participants do not disclose their trading intention to the exchange prior to execution there is no order book visible to the public trade execution details are only released to the consolidated tape after a delaythe institutional seller has a better chance of getting a buyer for the full share block in a dark pool since it is a forum dedicated to large investors the possibility of price improvement also exists if the midpoint of the quoted bid and ask price is used for the transaction of course this assumes that there is no information leakage of the investors proposed sale and that the dark pool is not vulnerable to highfrequency trading hft predators who could engage in frontrunning once they get a whiff of the investors trading intentions types of dark pools as of april there were dark pools in the us consisting of the following three typesbrokerdealer owned these dark pools are set up by large brokerdealers for their clients and may also include their own proprietary traders these dark pools derive their own prices from order flow so there is an element of price discovery examples of such dark pools of which there were as of april include credit suisses crossfinder goldman sachs sigma x citis citi match and citi cross and morgan stanleys ms poolagency broker or exchangeowned these are dark pools that act as agents not as principals as prices are derived from exchanges such as the midpoint of the national best bid and offer nbbo there is no price discovery examples of agency broker dark pools include instinet liquidnet and itg posit while exchangeowned dark pools include those offered by bats trading and nyse euronextelectronic market makers these are dark pools offered by independent operators like getco and knight who operate as principals for their own account like the brokerdealer owned dark pools their transaction prices are not calculated from the nbbo so there is price discoverypros and consthe advantages of dark pools are as follows reduced market impact as noted earlier the biggest advantage of dark pools is that market impact is significantly reduced for large orderslower transaction costs transaction costs may be lower since dark pool trades do not have to pay exchange fees while transactions based on the bidask midpoint do not incur the full spreaddark pools have the following drawbacks exchange prices may not reflect the real market if the amount of trading in dark pools owned by brokerdealers and electronic market makers continues to grow stock prices on exchanges may not reflect the actual market for example if a wellregarded mutual fund owns of company rsts stock and sells it off in a dark pool the sale of the stake may fetch the fund a good price but unwary investors who have just bought rst shares will have paid too much for it since the stock could well collapse once the funds sale becomes public knowledgepool participants may not get the best price the lack of transparency in dark pools can also work again a pool participant since there is no guarantee that the institutions trade was executed at the best price lewis points out in flash boys that a surprisingly large proportion of brokerdealers dark pool trades get executed within the pools a process known as internalization even in cases where the brokerdealer has a small share of the us market as lewis notes the dark pools opaqueness can also give rise to conflicts of interest if a brokerdealers proprietary traders trade against pool clients or if the brokerdealer sells special access to the dark pool to hft firmsvulnerability to predatory trading by hfts the recent controversy over dark pools has been spurred by lewis claims that dark pool client orders are ideal fodder for predatory trading practices by some hft firms which employ tactics such as pinging dark pools to unearth large hidden orders and then engage in front running or latency arbitragesmall average trade size reduces need for dark pools somewhat surprisingly the average trade size in dark pools has declined to only about shares exchanges like the new york stock exchange nyse who are seeking to stem their loss of trading marketshare to dark pools and alternative trading systems claim that this small trade size makes the case for dark pools less than compellingcurb appeal the recent hft controversy has drawn significant regulatory attention to dark pools regulators have generally viewed dark pools with suspicion because of their lack of transparency and the controversy may lead to renewed efforts to curb their appeal one measure which may help exchanges reclaim market share from dark pools and other offexchange venues could be a pilot proposal from the securities and exchange commission sec to introduce a tradeat rule the rule would require brokerages to send client trades to exchanges rather than dark pools unless they can execute the trades at a meaningfully better price than that available in the public market if implemented this rule could present a serious challenge to the longterm viability of dark poolsbottom linedark pools provide pricing and cost advantages to buyside institutions such as mutual funds and pension funds and these benefits ultimately accrue to the retail investors who own these funds however dark pools lack of transparency makes them susceptible to conflicts of interest by their owners and predatory trading practices by hft firms the recent hft controversy has drawn increasing regulatory attention to dark pools and implementation of the proposed tradeat rule could pose a threat to their longterm viability filed under banking industry banking terminology technical analysis

depending on your viewpoint name given to a network that allow traders to buy or sell large orders without running the risk other traders will work out what is going on and put the price up or down to take advantage of the order they have been criticised for their lack of transparency and because the inevitable fragmentation of trading could lead to less efficient pricing in traditional open stock exchanges in dark pools pretrade prices the price at which shares are offered for sale are not visible to anyone even the participants in them and the price at which shares change hands is only revealed after the trade is done the purpose of dark pools the primary purpose of dark pools is to minimise market impact by restricting access to undesired market participants such as high frequency trading firms and by not revealing quotes dark pools enable institutional investors to minimise their information leakage and realise more efficient executions more specifically dark trading facilities provide the possibility of price improvement and reduced transaction costs by crossing orders at the midpoint of the quoted best bid and offer prices thereby saving on both the bidoffer spread and on exchange fees for these reasons dark pools have been popular for the execution of large block orders the prevalence of dark pools at the beginning of it was estimated that nondisplayed trading accounted for a third of total volume in the us and dark pools about per cent of total volume a similar volume was said to be taking place in europe rapid growth had been noted of about per cent over the preceding three years in the us while in europe trading in dark pools relative to orderbook activity had more than doubled over the preceding two years why trading in dark pools has been growing dark pools have become prevalent due to technological developments that have lowered costs allowing brokerdealers to route more of the order flow they handle to their own private pools first before sending unwanted orders to the public markets dark pools in the news in the us in april chief executives of nyse euronext nasdaq omx and bats global markets argued for regulators to introduce rules permitting transactions to only take place away from a public exchange if a customer is getting a muchimproved price they pointed to similar steps taken by canadian and australian regulators to combat the rise of off exchange trading otherwise known as dark pools in june new yorks top securities regulator sued barclays for allegedly favouring high speed traders in its dark pool the complaint
