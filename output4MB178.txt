and was awarded on the dismount by one tv commentator who also hailed his tree iron however he doublebogeyed the hole and pulled out of the tournament soon after play was halted as he trailed woods by

LinkPage: share this print email more sharing reddit stumbleupon delicious tiger regains no ranking by cnn staff updated pm edt mon march tiger woods right congratulates rory mcilroy after europes remarkable victory over the us on the final day of the ryder cup in september the two are big rivals on the golf course but a friendship has also blossomed this year golf great nick faldo has questioned whether they should be so close sports psychologist dan abrahams says they would benefit from keeping a bit of distance in the heat of battle it becomes more difficult to emotionally detach yourself from that persons performance if youre good friends with that person he told cnn mcilroy has admitted idolizing woods as a boy but has now usurped him as golfs no once they step on the first tee those competitive juices are flowing and theyre focused either on their own game or beating each other abrahams said they are following in golfs great tradition of rivalries most notably jack nicklaus left and arnold palmer the power of the mind and the capability of that mental discipline is what separates the good from the great sports leadership expert khoi tu told cnn that might allow them to become friends with people off the course but not on the course formula ones greatest rivalry was between alain prost and ayrton senna they absolutely detested each other tu says they were two very different personalities and often thats one of the features of great sporting rivalries fire and ice fernando alonso left has now twice been beaten to the f championship by sebastian vettel who is widely rumored to be his teammate at ferrari come when you get two no drivers together with no team rules then the sparks can really fly tu says its rare for them to be good mates they may get along they may trust and respect each other in a professional capacity but hanging out is a different issue former world champion jackie stewart seen here playing with the children of f rival graham hill was remarkably friendly with his peers tu says he was incredibly fond of a number of people who drove with him that partly is because there was a clearer distinction of him being a number one and them being number two drivers a new rivalry has grown in tennis this year between us open and olympic champion andy murray left and childhood friend novak djokovic the world no people say that murray and djokovic are close but i think its rare tu says the best sporting rivalries are the ones where there are these very distinct almost opposite personalities but theyre very close in terms of their competence rafael nadal left ended the tennis dominance of roger federer but they have publicly expressed their friendship despite reports of arguments about ontour issues as people get older theyve done so much broken lots of records i think that competitive edge is slightly dulled tu says that makes it easier to be friendlier you can keep your dignity if youre not crying every time you lose to a younger faster athlete martina navratilova left and chris evert had one of the biggest rivalries in womens tennis they ended up as good buddies but that was when the battling had been done tu says all of the respect and friendship you get in sport comes through competence first i know how hard it is to be this good so i respect them for that fiery american john mcenroe left and icecool swede bjorn borg created an iconic tennis rivalry when those two collided at the height of tennis perfection thats when the audience is really enthused and enthralled tu says to get that rivalry they have to leave any friendship on the sidelines sometimes you get two great athletes but they are too close to be proper rivals such as tennis star serena williams left and her sister venus the great things about sport is the sense of competition the uncertainty of the outcome the fairness of the playing field tu says you might be able to suspend enough of your fraternal or sisterly love to play a decent game of tennis but it wont reach the heights of the rivalries that make the sport muhammad ali left demonized joe frazier to hype up their fights despite being showed respect outside the ring by his rival he came up with the gorilla term to create a spectacle which he knew was important but it revved himself up too tu says he needed to have a real enemy by the end of the manila fight he said that frazier brought out the best of him then theres modern footballs greatest rivalry lionel messi and cristiano ronaldo im not sure messi is a rival with anyone he still has that unique joy of just playing tu says but i think with ronaldo the truth is messi is his nemesis and the fact that messi doesnt care makes it even worse hide caption best buddies too close beating your idol nicklaus vs palmer prost vs senna alonso vs vettel f friendly murray vs djokovic nadal vs federer navratilova vs evert mcenroe vs borg serena vs venus ali vs frazier messi vs ronaldo ltlt lt gt gtgt cnn tiger
