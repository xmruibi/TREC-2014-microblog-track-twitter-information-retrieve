photobill roth anchorage daily news by rachel d oro the associated press anchorage changes are planned for alaskas iditarod trail sled dog race following the asphyxiation death of a dog that was buried in snow by extreme winds organizers of the mile race said wednesday race officials said they also plan to meet with the owners of yearold dorado the dog was found dead at a checkpoint friday four days after he was removed from the race because he was moving stiffly he was kept in unalakleet to await transportation home dorado belonged to the team of iditarod rookie paige drobny of fairbanks who continued in the race with the rest of her team finishing thursday in th place drobnys husband cody strathe said this week that the couple asked the iditarod trail committee to develop new protocols for the care of dogs that have been dropped from the race to nome on alaskas windbattered coast the iditarod trail committee said planned changes include construction of dog shelters at two major checkpoints and more frequent checks on the animals this type of selfexamination is an important part of itcs historical commitment to the improvement of the welfare of the canine athletes that annually participate in the race officials said in a statement race officials declined to assign blame to anyone including a volunteer veterinarian who last checked on dogs that were tethered outside at the unalakleet checkpoint around am friday itc does not believe it or any others acted negligently in any way relating to the death of dorado or that dorados death was foreseeable the statement says race officials said the severe weather prevented planes from landing so more than dropped dogs accumulated at the village more than two dozen race volunteers moved as many dogs as possible placing slightly more than inside an available hangar according to organizers the rest of the dogs including dorado were moved to a more protected area considered the safest place to minimize accumulation of blowing snow dorado was found dead after the next check at am race organizers said seven other dogs also were covered with snow and all except dorado were in good condition while not optimal organizers said it isnt typically a condition that would cause alarm sled dogs generally curl up in weather conditions such as this and are insulated by the snow they said unalakleet miles from nome is one of the two communities where the socalled dog boxes will be built for shelter the village is a major hub for dogs removed from the race for various reasons including injury sickness or tiredness another planned change is more frequent flights to transport dropped dogs more quickly from checkpoints that are not on alaskas limited road system dorados death prompted people for the ethical treatment of animals to send a letter to nome district attorney john earthman asking for animal cruelty charges to be filed for alleged criminal negligence in the death state law says the animal cruelty section does not apply to generally accepted dog mushing or pulling contests or practices or rodeos or stock contests but earthman said wednesday says that clause is open to debate he said he was reviewing the letter and no decision has been made on whether to proceed he declined to comment on the merits of the allegation but said to convict someone of animal cruelty means the circumstances have to be much more than an accident he noted its not unusual in the region for dogs to be outside overnight in similar conditions you have to have a gross deviation from reasonable conduct under the circumstances he said i know for a fact there were plenty of dogs out in that very storm all up and down the coast of western alaska the death was the first iditarod dog death since when six dogs died iditarod officials said dorados death was the first time in memory that an incident of this type has occurred peta says more than dogs have died since the iditarod began in comment
