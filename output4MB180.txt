LinkPage: claudia says july at pm you ve said everything here that i ve been saying only with far greater eloquence brava linda says july at pm excellent points of course they wanted to draw viewers using the recognizable names of sherlock holmes and dr watson i will tune in and try to suppress my instinct to compare the characters with what i expect from the books and the outstanding bbc sherlock if it s good on its own merits i will watch but it won t make me love bbc sherlock any less as benedict says there is room linda says july at pm i should add that i hope it is good there is always room for quality red raven says july at pm oh how spot on this comment is i love you whoever you are charley says july at am i must admit it does seem very likely that they are cashing in on the movie s and series success and that is why they have used the names sherlock on watson to publicise more than anything this show wouldn t of got half as much spotlight if it didn t have their names i get the feeling that this show would of gone down better if the makers and actors would just stop pretending they have based this off the books because going by the trailer all they have in fact done is take the name holmes amp watson johnny says he has based the character of the books but the trailer made me think he picked up the wrong book by accident this is what is annoying me most really about the show the fact the cast and crew seem to be in denial of this the trailer shows us that all they have done is took the names of the characters for publicity with no intention of actually making it anything like sherlock holmes yet they continue to talk a load of well rubbish really granted i know the trailer is only minutes but considering trailers are supposed to draw us in i think it is fair to base our arguments on it i m still willing to give it a watch because we could be wrong but i doubt it bonnie says july at am that is the main point that is maybe at the heart of the reaction to elementary its not that a tv show is being made and everyone there is to do their job etc but all the talk about it being different than sherlock as if out of nowhere they decided to do a sherlock holmes tv show and this is how they invisioned it from the beginning is not how it was they did want to remake the show that we know as sherlock and were told no linda says july at am i expect they will also keep his ability to deduce all sorts of things from his observations and perhaps his experiments claire says august at am well said the same can almost be said of robert d jr s interpretation i enjoyed jude law as watson the settings were lovely but the movos were trying to be a period action too hard when ieliminated the fact that it was the sherlock holmes i was meant to be seeing i could enjoy the movies much better as the scruffy holmes they chose to portray i simply could not reconcile with the original researchgrrrl says august at am claire i do wish the set up would allow me to reply to you rather than my own comment i think the reason i cut the rdj version a bit more slack was because a it was developed without even knowing that moffatt and gatiss had decided to go for a modern version of the stories and instead because mainstream studios are slowly and belatedly starting to notice that neovictoriana and steampunk visuals have a lot of appeal and b making sherlock brawny and living in his body as much as he does his mind was the only crucial change jude law s watson is still a former soldier still a respected medical doctor and there as sherlock s flatmate and friend rather than having his companionship paid for by sherlock s father oh and he s also still a chap the movies are set in essentially the original time period and setting albeit skewing toward that neovictorianasteampunk feel so a sweaty scruffy holmes at least still has the right context including his interactions with and reactions from watson in which to operate and i m only expected to suspend that one significant element of disbelief i can do that without any problem and enjoy it about as much as i would any other earnest piece of silly fanfic for me successful pastiche works sort of along the lines of scientific research change one independent variable the time period sherlock s investment in the physical world and you can explore how everything else is affected as a result change all the variables cbs s elementary has changed while still claiming to be based in acd canon and you have a lot of your potential audience going are you kidding me if they re being polite that day all i can do is point again to fox s house house and wilson were based holmes and watson and many of their qualities mapped directly on to the originals but the creators never tried to convince us we were watching the adventures of holmes and watson they made sure to pay tribute to their series inspiration over the years but otherwise went about creating their own fullyrealised universe anyway all that to say i found the recent movie adaptations easy to watch in a way i expect i ll have trouble doing with elementary i haven t ruled out the possibility of enjoying it but the are you kidding me is strong with this one also i had the pleasure of watching both versions of frankenstein featuring jlm and ben i enjoyed their respective monsters fairly equally but ben s victor blew jlm s out of the water ben did what even ken branagh tried but couldn t quite do he made victor a sympathetic character i ve never come across another performer who managed that and that ability to make even victor a sympathetic character very much shows in ben s sociopathic sherlock we can see why john and lestrade like him jlm did not demonstrate anything near so interesting or compelling as victor that s also shaping my apprehension about his attempt at sherlock jack says july at pm yes i ve never seen it but this will suck cause i m an idiot and i make snap judgements before i actually have evidence yeah internet reply larry david says july at pm seems like you re mad that everyone thinks this will suck because it will suck reply sggrant says july at pm suck or not it will still pull better ratings on cbs than sherlock on pbs temis says july at pm hee hee well the real story here is the cbs audience doesn t know or care what s on the bbc cbs is taking public domain character and shaping it to the tastes of their audience which they do supremely well as evidenced by their continuing success in an industry that is rapidly going down the tubes all the other networks are struggling in the ratings but cbs is a ratings generating machine their sherlock will be a big hit and the fans here will cry bitterly about it but it won t make the slightest difference to cbs i won t be watching the show but i m not cbss audience so why would i they don t make shows for me or for the people in this thread and they do very well with that approach reply jim from it says august at am eloquently put anderson mycroft start a war before you got home did he all we where doing was having a friendly little discussion then you come along acting like someone killed your dinosaur well i believe congratulations are in order as you single handily lowered the iq of the entire comment section so why don t you go away and stop inflicting your opinions on the world sh ps your wife is having an affair best call sally round laterz reply iloveyourcomment says august at am wanted to say that i love your comment it brought a huge smile to my fae seeing all the references to bbc s sherlock now i am gonna go watch reichenbach and have all these feelings liddad says july at pm i think the bbc s will stay the best as they have an hour and a half for each episode and much more time spent on the production and writing of each individual episode so that the small number of episodes that there are is still as if not more satisfying because it s like we got featurelength films reply jules says july at pm agree steven moffatt s sherlock is the best guy ricthie s sherlock hmm not bad cbs s sherlock will suck cbs and us television must stop copy people s idea and start to be creative honestly i have a big sympathy to miller he is a good actor i really like him as much as i like bc but playing in something is not really original and watson is female i don t think so isn t sherlock holmes is about masculinity and bromance reply tehimas says october at am i am totally agree with you reply sherlock fan says october at am this is what benedict said i hate to blow our own trumpet but we did actually start it we did the pilot waaay before they wanted to do the film and in fact its rumored that the weinsteins and other people that had to do with warner had already heard about the property the idea that we were doing a modern adaptation of it and thought ah we havent had sherlock holmes in a long time as a movie franchise and it popped up you know we were a bit sour about it at the beginning we were kind of oh really really were just getting off the ground with this idea and then we saw it and went aw its great we can both exist at the same time and i just think that elementary is just a rip off sherlock bbc i mean come on even the title card is a copy i bet they just thought oh yeah hav u seen that british show which is modern day sherlock holmes lets do a copy but in america artem says july at pm indeed reply templar says july at pm imo miller reads as more of a serial killer than ace detective i ll give it a try but i m not optimistic bc is a class act and good for him taking the high road reply maja says july at pm joan watson and else i think honestly he does feel a bit weird about it especially because a friend of his plays holmes but overall i agree that i don t see why they shouldn t try and do their version reply goku says july at pm am i the only one who thinks there is also sexual tension between sherlock and watson gt reply minkoz says july at pm bless you for this comment reply lauramc says july at pm you are most definitely not alone reply keren says july at pm haha no i think that they are just a good bromance reply billyandme says july at pm not alone at all reply shannon says july at pm nope i was going to post the same thing reply nochance says july at pm no you re not alone but we know that it s always going to be subtext and will never turn into will theywon t theywhen will they with elementary i m almost certain that cbs will draw in the shippers by keeping up the ust for as long as possible reply a rosenfeld says july at pm i don t think there is any sexual tension between sampw in bbc s sherlock quite the contrary sherlock is obviously uncomfortable with personal intimacy and watson has a liking for the ladies i frankly am tired of people being incapable of accepting two men s love and devotion for each other as just that sex does not always have to enter the picture between two individuals frodo and samwise is another good example i am a straight woman with many male and female friends whom i love and care very deeply for but i have no interest in having sex with them reply linda says july at pm thank you it s sad our culture has been so sexualized that a lot of people are incapable of seeing any affection between two people without thinking it means they want to sleep together reply mary says july at pm yes yes yes i couldn t have said it better reply kathy says july at pm thank you for expressing my feelings exactly i too am a little weary of slashing reply brandy says july at pm see this is how i see housewilson no ust at all it was great just as it was one of the great bromances john and sherlock not so much i ve never been a fan of any slash pairing anywhere but this one practically jumps off the screen at me reply emily says july at pm it s partly a fantasy thing i personally being a slash shipper can attest to the fact that i do realize that the sherlock x john romance shall most likely never be but i still do it and bask in all of it s adorableness it just makes me warm and fuzzy thinking about it i wish it would happen but it probably won t although there are subtle hints in the show that could give one the impression of there being a bit more than a bromance lol xd and we aren t idiots for christ s sake we don t think that if you are close to someone in any way shape or form that it means you want to fck them to put it bluntly i at least am not that ignorant considering i also have friends whom i don t want to fck coughs sorry if i sounded a bit angryvicious there just is a bit annoying when someone takes you for an idiot reply renee says july at pm thank you reply moni says august at pm i totally agree sherlock does not want to wasteclutter his energy on romance he has his senses focused on the work which without his mind would rot as he so emphatically stated reply gilda says july at pm if the showrunners went down that road i would die from happiness you re not the only one reply holland says july at pm i don t remember who said this but the fact that they both need each other but not necessarily want each other is part of appeal to both of them who said anything about soul mates needing to be romantically involved reply bobbi says july at am if the actual characters of holmes and watson were written in the books as gay then fine but holmes doesn t have time for anything like that one way or the other and watson is straight sherlock and john in the tv do need each other both of their lives were changed when they met each other the show does use that as what some from the outside might be thinking but its not so and i have yet to see john watson who is always trying to find a date give any impression he would be interested in sherlock other than a friend they have great chemistry these are wonderful actors who just happen to work together perfectly and chemistry is not the same as wanting to have a sexual relationship but anyone has a right to think what they do about them it is still a fantasy reply mikael says july at am there definitely is in the robert downey jr amp jude law sherlock amp watson reply kara says july at pm i love this guy so classy can t wait for season three of sherlock still on the fence about elementary reply sk says july at pm agreed reply jack says july at pm how can you be on the fence about something you haven t even seen odd reply larry david says july at pm seems like youre mad that everyone thinks this will suck because it will suck reply olivia says july at pm well i dunno maybe just maybe she could be on the fence as to if she even wants to watch it oh i dunno it can t possibly be that reply jennifer says july at pm it worked on hawaii with kono although as watson i don t know how she s going to keep her hands off jonny lee miller i know i couldn t reply sovietkitsch says july at pm i m a bbc sherlock fan but i loathe the overtly proud and somewhat obnoxious attitude of some bbc sherlock fans about elementary it s ridiculous so what if cbs is hopping on the sherlock holmes bandwagon countless adaptations have been done some fans think bbc had the only rights to do a modern retelling the show hasn t even premiered yet and it has been met with comments from lamenting on lucy liu s casting to johnny s scarf copying from benedict s sherlock and the reviews i ve heard of elementary s pilot episode screening in comic con were great so i think i ll give it a shot reply brooke says july at pm agreed i have read so many different sherlock holmes adaptations over the years and they re all fun and entertaining whenever i hear about a new one i look forward to getting it from the library if there can be dozens of sherlock holmes books written by different authors over the years there can definitely be two shows with different spins on it as long as it s well written and enjoyable i m all for it reply temis says july at pm yeah i ve been seeing pro cbs backlash because of the obnoxious and prejudiced fans who rant about a show that s yet to even air however it doesn t matter what any of us say or think about this because the cbs audience is not the same group of people who comment on websites like this cbs knows their audience and they re making a show for their audience not for any of us reply charley says july at am i think the problem that most are having it not the fact they are making the show because they are clearly free to do so it is the fact that they only seem to have taken the names sherlock and watson for publicity the trailer and press interviews show us that the characters barely resemble those in the books yet the cast and crew are still denying this fact saying they have gone back to the books although just to add in this case i think it is fairly obvious they are just trying to pull in profit from the movie and bbc series this being said i still believe that elementry has the potential to be a good show just that it is also going to be a terrible interpretation of the books at the same time ie it will barely resemble them this is what is seems to be making most people mad me included but this being said as someone pointed out above it will still probably do well i will certainly give it a go just a general question though am i the only one who thinks johnny s acting in the trailer is terrible like he is a bit bored and didn t but any effort in but not in a good sherlock way but rather in a terrible acting way which is strange because he was fantastic in frankenstein reply mandy says july at pm tbh i think he s good in general in the trailer but not in the way as sherlock holmes and no he is not great in frankenstein miller is not as solid on stage comparing with genuinely seasoned stage actors he s much better on tv and in films reply bobbi says july at pm it seems to me with just watching the previews that jonny is playing sherlock as a hyper person there s a moment where he almost seems wildeyed maybe it s because he is off the drugs there is barely mention of the cocaine in the books from what i ve heard from people and coping with that but maybe that might just be in the pilot and he kind of calms down usa today had an article on the cbs shows and the producer said our sherlock has emerged with a tiny kernel of selfdoubt where one never existedi don t see him as a sociopath i see him as someone who s driven to do the right thing ok reply hamza says december at pm oh come on darling tell me youre someone who wouldnt fight for a phenomenal cause reply lisa says july at pm i haven t seen cumberbatch s sherlock and every time he opens his mouth i am less inclined to ever watch it maybe it s something that is lost in translation but he always seems to be looking down his nose at everyone else i am looking forward to seeing elementary this fall however reply suds says july at pm ridiculous accusation benedict has never said a bad word about anyone unjustingly reply me says july at pm your loss reply tmort says july at pm you re really missing out if you re a holmes fan you are doing a disservice to yourself if you don t try the fantastic bbc version and at least give it a shot not sure why you think cumberbatch is looking down his nose at everyone else from various reports from people who work with him actors producers directors etc he is a truly kind and generous actor being that he is a friend of jlm and they worked together very closely for a national theatre production in i believe he is sincere about the well wishes for the cbs version even though i m a huge fan of the bbc version and of cumberbatch i m going to give this version a try it s not like i ll be out anything but some time if i dislike it reply me says july at pm did you miss the part where he said he wishes them good luck and thinks the show is going to be good how is that looking down his nose at everyone else reply giraffe says july at pm but he always seems to be looking down his nose at everyone else really since when reply saint alicia says july at pm agreed everything out of his mouth is wrapped in condescension god forbid tv is deprived of another male friendship there s a dearth of those these days and don t you know a malefemale friendship could never stack up to the bedrock of a bromance oh but excuse me there s absolutely nothing romantic between the bbc s holmes and watson moffat shouting no homo in every interview should ve put that to rest though why is bandicoot cumbersnatch even weighing in on this in the first place am i missing the relevance of an actor from a different show and remake in it s own right providing his inputblessing he must be the reincarnation of conan doyle otherwise who cares what he thinks and elementary won t steal bbc viewers because it s automatically positioned to have a separate bigger audience just by virtue of being an american production on cbs bc should stick to complaining about downton abbey s large crossover appeal compared to sherlock s cult status he needn t move on to elementary reply linda says july at pm he weighs in on it because everyone asks him about it benedict has an educated brit accent and a natural british reserve that is not condescension i agree that us fans should give elementary a chance and it s unfortunate they are bashing it without seeing it but that is not benedict s fault or anything he has encouraged you are doing exactly the same thing in reverse reply saint alicia says july at pm benedict has an educated brit accent the hell does that have to do with anything especially a print interview i swear reply linda says july at pm since you said everything out of his mouth i assumed you had readseen other interviews i apologize for my assumption if that s not the case btw he didn t complain about downton s appeal he and a friend from downton were teasing each other and his comments were taken out of context and misrepresented the media loves to overdramatize and create feuds where they don t exist so they can sell paperstv ads it is hard to determine attitude condescension etc from written not to mention edited versions of interviews so give the guy a break plus you need to take into account the differences between american and british ways of expression hamza says december at pm well ofcourse the british accent is intimidating numbnuts conductoroflight says july at pm i must politely insist that your opinion of benedict is severely misinformed there is a media trap that surrounds benedict misuse of quotes leaving out explanations or context specifically for the controversy it could stir such as the downtown abbey complaints which was actual a tease between friend i think you ll find if you look more into his full interviews you ll see his a severely humble very generous man reply erika says july at pm because elementary has been taking every chance to cause buzz by utilizing the popularity of the bbc s sherlock including hiring miller who was cumberbatch s costar on the stage production frankenstein in which they shared two main roles and swapped every night in and the press has been asking cumberbatch the question since cbs announced its plan i even suspect this socall new interview with cumberbatch was done when he s in nyc to promote sherlock s in this may in other words not a new interview at all i m not against elementary but i don t like what cbs has done to generate buzz for it if i didn t already know i d thought that it s cumberbatch to star as sherlock holmes in elementary if you don t like to see so many elementary news getting cumberbatch included go ask cbs to stop using him to publicize elementary thank you very much reply templar says july at pm watch cumberbatch as hugh laurie s son in fortysomething nothing arrogant about him he s the real deal and a fine example of a brit actor reply tmort says july at pm yes great show great acting all around by bc really stands out reply elatus says july at am see the show and than comment my view to the both side of discussion if you don t want to see bbc sherlock lisa then don t but the reason is somehow ridiculous benedict is in very awkward position here between his good breed friendship with jlm and producers of his show saying that he sound proud is the last thing i would say about it reply jw says july at pm bets on how fast are they going to try to get joan to holmes bed only reason to change it reply ley leyla says july at pm i dont think theyll steal our audience he s so right because bbc sherlock s is absolutely unique and its fans are adamantly loyal and truly addicted to this really good show reply keren says july at pm and the bbc only do episodes a year so they can easily share the audience reply keren says july at pm only does reply bow says july at pm i have to laugh at the cbs production team posting on here they wont be laughing when the ratings slip reply nick says july at pm why would it it s cbs s most buzzedabout pilot and most critics who saw it at comiccon liked it reply moni says august at pm critics don t make a show s ratings we do reply nick says august at pm that s what i meant by cbs s most buzzedabout pilot reply j says july at pm maybe we want to see a different dynamic and to see something new isn t something you should be frightened of reply sk says july at pm cumberbatch is very gracious class act while i feel that cbs should be ashamed of the way it brought elementary to the screen cumberbatch is right in that the bbc s sherlock has nothing to fear from elementary i also believe that the sexual tension of elementary will greatly alter the dynamics of the narrative which forecloses some and opens up other directions for narrative exploration for better or worse shall be seen and i really do not like that they ve basically turned dr watson into holmes na watchdog sorry but that s just lame reply babygirl says july at pm benedict is far from being a snob or looking down his nose you apparently do not know anything about him of course he has said something he does dislike immensley is mediocrity which is apparent because it s something he doesn t get involved with as said if you know what the people who work with him say then you would not be saying what you did he s a generous person and so intelligent and they just can t praise him enough he was brought up speaking correct english and surrounded by acting parents and people who spoke well and tho they were not rich actors he went to good schools with help from his grandmother knowlege is important to him and he cares very much for the work he does anyone on here who hasn t seen sherlock there are ways to find it to check it out actually i just see sherlock and john as friends moffat and gatiss and ben also see them as one of the great friendships and that s all of all time people can see what they want but have never seen anything but that reply hcdp says july at pm when i first heard about elementary i thought it was going to just be a copy cat version of the bbc s sherlock now however having heard more of the basic premise besides it being a modern update i m curious about the direction they want to take this though i have to agree i am a little apprehensive about a female watson there are so many ways it can be done right and be absolutely fantastic but it can go wrong much more easily if the whole cast and crew are able to keep that solid friendship between the two especially with waston being a woman and transform it into something different because a friendship between men and women is different added sexual tension or not i think the show can work i just don t want to see their relationship being all about the will they won t they reply mare says july at pm i tried the bbc s sherlock for two seasons and i honestly don t understand the fuss i can t stand their sherlock he is irredeemably obnoxious the only one i like is watson so i m really looking forward to a version of holmes that doesn t make me hate the lead and i m honestly annoyed by all the superior bbc sherlock fans looking down on this show they haven t even seen yet guess what not everyone likes your precious show and it doesn t mean we have no taste so how about you all stop bashing this show and nonsherlock fans and stop it with your condescension this version may or may not be great but yours isn t the precious perfection you all think it is either reply red raven says july at pm every fandoms have fans like that it s just hard for them to swallow another sherlock holmes story after being fed with guy ritchie s and bbc s version it s okay if don t like the show even jeremy brett s watson david burke doesn t think highly of bbc sherlock because he thinks theirs is betterwhich i slightly agree on but i really think bbc sherlock done well enough the original sherlock holmes isn t likable at all even some of his friends loathe his attitude the only thing fans love in him is his charisma intellect and the way he solves things so if you re trying to find a not obnoxious sherlock holmes then i think you re wasting your time plus judging from the trailer cbs s sherlock holmes is not likable either reply paul says december at am my favorite comment holmes has become a bit domesticated over the many decades of adaptation the original version was polite but not likeable now that time has passed and i ve seen several episodes of elementary it seems to me that doyle s creation is like shakespeare there s room enough for many versions miller is doing a great job and the writers have gone out of their way to squelch any romance i m surprised i like lucy liu in the role i think it only works because she s not the faithful sidekick but has her own issues i d say benedict was spot on when he suggested they would have to walk a tightrope because that is what they are managing to do so far reply barbie furtado says july at pm you know i don t like bbc s version as much either and it s because i can t stand him he s absolutely superior he treats people badly and his intelligence isn t all that impressive and i ve never grown attached to watson also it s a double episode in the british pace which makes it suuuupppppeeer sloooowww and it makes it very tiring to watch i still haven t watched last season s finale because i don t have the patience for it and i m not american i m brazilian i ve read every single sherlock holmes book by the age of i wanted to love it like most everyone does i really do love guy ritichie s version but i never got into the show i know they re going to change everything in elementary but i m not judging just yet i was a huge fan of the rizzoli amp isles books and i possibly love the show more than the books now and they changed everything but their names just about reply brandy says july at pm you ve read the books and you think bbc s sherlock is too unlikeable i get uncomfortable during the books because holmes treats watson so badly he s a total asshole in canon at least he bbc version is an asshole who s interesting to watch reply barbie furtado says july at pm i just don t agree with you i think he s an arrogant snot in the show in the books his brilliancy shows through in the show he seems like a conceited kid reply conductoroflight says july at pm well consider the age of the characters you re discussing he seems like a conceited kid because he is one in a way in most of the books john and sherlock have been together for some time and they re both over sherlock is in his early s in this version and john is about and the series starts when they ve only just meet one another their chemistry is automatic but sherlock hasn t had a companion for most if not all of his adult life he s still learning how to interact with people in a way that isn t only a means to an end part of the subtle wonder of this show is watching how john s presence as sherlock s one and only friend changes the detective bonnie says july at pm as the comment said the show starts out with them meeting for the first time in their s that s one of the things moffat wanted to do to show them at the beginning and then show what happens when watson comes into the picture rem lestrad close saying sherlock was a great man and someday he might be a good one even at the end of the first show when watson counters with his own because you re an idiot and sherlock smiles there s a scene in the first season where his friend from college says we all hated him you didn t notice the look on his face the way he looked down it s just a split second but that comment hurt him benedict is a master of having a look convey what is not said out loud the humor in it is wonderful the performances are great and for the people who do love the show think we see more to sherlock than just the surfacewe know he is a good man too barbie furtado says july at pm i m sorry but i disagree i don t think the show is funny i think she show s slow and unappealing i do get what they tried to do but i don t think in any way they achieved the mastery or brilliancy of the books i like the guy ritchie version much much more i truly really hate cumberbatch s sherlock i think robert downey jr s a million times better and i d never been a fan of his before i used to adore the books growing up i wanted to be a detective just like sherlock holmes i am extremely bummed at the british version linda says july at pm most of the episodes start out slow and build in pace imo i tend to watch most tv while doing something else i started watching sherlock that way and didn t get into it at first then i realized it was one of those shows that you have to pay close attention to when i did that i absolutely fell in love with the show i have watched all the episodes at least two or three times and there is so much more to see each time i almost never watch a tv show or movie more than once but sherlock keeps delivering reply bb says july at am i think not catching the humor means thinking it s suppose to be funny like a comedy it has wit which is diffierent than just being funny its in the way they interact with each other i like rdj but to me he is rdj being rdj with a british accent reply indi says july at pm love the bbc version it s beyond my favorite i mean i dare you to watch it and not think its brilliant however i also love guy ritichie s movie version with rdj ad jude law do you i think they should have turned john into a girl no but i ll certainly not judge till i ve seen it i just wish the us didn t try to marginalize and remake every popular brit show reply michael sacal says july at pm crossover sherlocks of two worlds reply michael sacal says july at pm two sherlocks are better than one come on they could say that they are related through their fathers and that one stole the other s name for their son because they thought it was cool or something reply sbental says august at am that could be epic reply amanda says july at pm whatever people are mad about watson being a girl because then they can t pretend that holmes and watson are gay together during elementary by this point i m sick of steven moffat and i hope lucy liu plays everyone s favorite white male characters lord knows there are plenty of them reply molly says july at am if lucy liu could act that might be some kind of a threat but as i ve seen more animated blocks of wood than ms liu it s more of a joke reply linda says july at am i thought she was excellent in her guest arc on southland reply gerard says july at pm but when they make a teen sherlock holmes that hunts vampires and is going to sing all the time that s when i stop watchingha ha lets just wait and see reply red raven says july at pm i think someone s going to make sherlock holmes vs frankenstein try searching that reply temis says july at pm coming this fall on the cw reply gandalftheblack says july at am you have no idea how awesomely brilliant that idea is i hope someone will make it happen reply bobbiel says july at pm of course not everyone is going to like sherlock but the people who do love it love it to make up for the ones that don t sherlock holmes has always been a pain but in a way that s the fun of himthere s a lot of dry humor in that tho just thought if i didn t like the character the first time i watched itwhy watch whole seasons of someone you don t like tho you did like watson so did you turn down the tv when sherlock was on even tho you don t like him you are seeing one of the greatest actors you are ever going to see when they were doing the voice over for study in pink moffat or gatiss were talking and watching a scene being shot and they thought where is benedict they just saw sherlockwhere did sweet affable benedict go we just love the show and we re not saying jonny isn t good or that it won t be written well etc we have seen the previews to see how at least it will play out to some extent possibly if sherlock was more well known in america it doesn t get much publicity and even tho it just got emmy nominations being on pbs is not like being on the main networks and the fact cbs went to the bbc to redo sherlock and they said no it s not the downy version they went after sometimes when america redoes a show from britain the show has already gone off the air so maybe that s some of the feeling so for those who don t like sherlock then hope you do really enjoy elementary simple as that and am sure both can be liked moffat amp gatiss just love pretty much anything that has sherlock attached to it so when they got to do their tv show it was a labor of love they talked about doing it years before they actually got around to it and it was a dream for them to do and were not sure how it was going to go but it turned out ok for them reply red raven says july at pm plus they deemed every plausible sherlock holmes before them canon guy ritchie s not included as it came the same time as them reply liddad says july at pm as a scotsman i m asking you to please spell downey with the e as without the e in scotland it s an extremely offensive term for a person with downs syndrome reply michelle says july at pm there s no reason you can t be a fan of both shows elementary can take the edge off the wait for more bbc sherlock and this is hardly benedict breaking his silence he s been asked several times about elementary and has said good things every time and he s right the dynamic will be different but different does not equal bad reply lickydisco says july at pm the only thing that would have made this brief article supurb dear michael is if you had audio to it so we bc fans could have gone all swoony over his lovely voice sigh he s so dreamy reply ewa says july at pm well we ll see in about two seasons if it stays on that long obviously even if they avoid the sexual tension during the first season they will start singing a different tune once they start running out of better ideas and by the third season we ll have the will theywon t they in full swing reply julie says july at pm one problem is falling into the usual cbs procedural category after a while as they say they won t be taking from the actual stories will be interesting to see where they go reply jack says july at pm bbc sherlock fanatics are hilarious it s not even that they don t want to share the character as if you know your precious moffat made him up out of thin air pffft but i think it s more the case of them wanting to be special oooh look at me i love this show from overseas and you haven t even heard of it oooh look how special and cool i am lmao reply larry david says july at pm seems like youre mad that everyone thinks this will suck because it will suck reply liddad says july at pm actually i m from the uk and everyone here loves it the same way as the us fans and it s not a small show over here around million people in the uk watched season live that s a sixth of the population this show isn t just good it s great that s why people are obsessed with it elementary may not be bad but due to the extremely high standard set by moffat and gatiss interpretations it s going to be almost impossible to beat reply jane says july at pm three years ago i started to get bored of american looooonnnggg series too much episodes too much seasons too much changing characters from evil to good to indetermined it sucks so i was looking for something different and found wire in the blood being human misfits the tudors and so on great series few episodes per season and straight to the point and a spanish friend told me about the bbc s sherlock and nearly forced me to watch it he told me it was a must to me i believed him and i thank god he told me of this serie my first impression was wth is this but did not leave i watched the long first episode and love it i love this sherlock because he made me feel exactly the same i felt when i read the books this undetermined sense of love and hate admiration and anger towards sherlock holmes benedict cumberbatch and martin freeman did a great job with such iconic characters i could give elementary a chance but i know it will be a long season of episodes and that repeles me and maybe if the show make it and gets another season then maybe the writers will finally permit watson to fck sherlock holmes i believe that is a not so hidden desire for people who has read the books well a desire from modern people who wants to see sex in everything but you people can give elementary a chance i have no doubt it will be a good show but i stay with this one of the bbc reply julie says july at pm feel maybe there was a bit of sarcasm with the voice comment nothing wrong with thinking someone has a great voice benedict has done a lot of audio books and voice overs over the years because people have wanted that voice representing them want to joke about them too reply bobbie says july at pm didn t you read that moffat amp gatiss know all about the doyle stories and the movies that have been made they would be the last people who would say they were doing something new they even say sherlock in victorian times was current and also the rathbone movies were done in current times i love sherlock but never have i felt superior because i want others to see it don t think its different than anything someone thinks is good and they enjoy wanting others to see it or read it etc then its up to the other person to like it or not no big deal reply chuck finley aj says july at pm i dunno i like mysteries and the bbc sherlock is movies a year i don t mind cbs giving it a try and i have to reserve judgment until i actually see what they have come up with i tend to trust cbs more than the like of abc and nbc when it comes to dramas reply chuck finley aj says july at pm and outside of his love for glee lol i tend to trust when ausiello says a show is good reply linda says july at pm it s not even episodes a year it s closer to episodes every months the next series will start filming in january after that the intervals may get even longer since both benedict cumberbatch and martin freeman are in increasing demand with high profile movie roles coming out in the next year the hobbit star trek both have said they want to continue doing sherlock but it may be harder and harder to coordinate their schedules one of the things i like about british actors is they tend to mix media throughout their careers doing tv film theater and radio american actors tend to stay mostly in one category though this has been changing hopefully elementary will be good enough to tide us over reply at says july at pm i don t see the problem in enjoying both i don t know why people are getting so upset over it seriously it s just silly reply jellygirl says july at pm jolly good pilot i must have missed something because i caught the pilot at comiccon and i have to say i wasn t impressed and it has nothing to do with watson being female i was actually pretty bored during the preview and only perked up once the panelqampa started maybe it was due to con fatigue my friend was literally falling asleep or maybe i just needed closed captions i couldn t help comparing it to bbc s sherlock and elementary just isn t as funny or clever reply temis says july at pm cbs knows exactly what they re doing making watson female if this were the cw then two male leas might work but cbs s audience is too conservative that you know what i mean cbs is going to have another brig hit show on their hands reply alisonyahoocom says july at pm the british version of sherlock is peerless and part of that is the fact that they re not churning out episodes a year they re really almost minimovies that said i love johnny miller eli stone was underrated and i would love to see him in a show that was worthy of his abilities but the addition of lucy liu as watson substantially lowers my interest level she s just not very interestingtalented and i can t see what she s bringing to the table besides breasts also to because of the very nature of us series tv i have to wonder how consistent the quality level of the writing will be i ll probably watch the pilot but at this point it s not a mustsee reply linda says july at pm i like eli stone a lot which is one reason i m looking forward to elementary i do like lucy liu too i m a huge fan of sherlock and benedict cumberbatch i first noticed him in a tiny and somewhat unsympathetic role in the other boleyn girl his face showed so much that in a few lines i wanted to know more about his character and was disappointed that was the last he showed up in the movie i didn t know who he was but i though this is an actor to watch for in the future reply bobbie says july at pm it s the actors sherlock has benedict cumberbatch who is just awesome the brit version of prime suspect had helen mirren you just can t throw an adequate actor into a show and expect to match a show that has superb actors helen mirren really carried prime suspect elementary has lucy liu so that s very encouraging reply line says july at pm i m a fan of bbc s sherlock and i don t resent the fact that cbs wanted to make their own version of sherlock holmes these characters and stories are certainly not the sole property of bbc and i don t even doubt the fact that the first episodes maybe even the first season will be quite good even though i m a little bit more skeptical in the long term what i do resent however is the fact that elementary is almost a contigency plan after they had been refused the rights to simply redo sherlock it seems so opportunistic i think i just don t understand why it s such a trend in the us to do remakes of successful foreign shows or movies when they are easily accessible in the country otherwise and in this case already in english so they can t even blame the language barrier reply monoi says july at pm i was replying this post it s like the us movie of millenium same movie maybe with more rythm but some scenes were almost exactly the same what s the point too often americans try to appropriate european movies or ideas to pretend they can do better reply chuck finley aj says july at pm no they buy the rights and make the movie in english with actors people have actually heard of here some of us watch the originals with subtitles but hollywood can almost always throw a bigger budget and bigger name actors at good material why gripe about it the people who own the rights to those movies sold them and lined their pockets with the cash you don t have to watch the american version if you don t want to and i am sure we can start listing foreign movies that were remade here that are actually better reply line says july at am so bigger name actors are always better and foreign actors are just good enough for other countries and if hollywood can do their own version of a movie or show or whatever then it s just logical to do it because they have a bigger budget sorry but i still don t understand i think it s a shame you sometimes close yourselves to styles that are different from the hollywood one and of course the people who sell those rights make a lot of money but you can see that in this case sherlock s creators must have thought the same because they refused to sell their concept reply moni says august at pm i m in the us and am so glad moffat and gatiss refused to sell their spin of sherlock to hollywood we will give elementary a chance here different strokes for different folks but personally my heart is already smitten with the british version they were the first to latch on to the modern sherlock and they have done a fantastic job please please please keep up the good work jay says july at pm i love the bbc version of sherlock as well as the movies and after watching the first preview of elementary i wasn t too thrilled about it but after more footage came out i sorta changed my mind miller brings a slightly different voice to sherlock which is good because we d all get tired of the same adaptation of sherlock done the same over and over again and some sort of variety is needed and i think it s a bit different with joan watson and the america setting but still you can t really judge it right now until the first few episodes because you still don t know whether elementary will be a rare gem or just another show that lasts a year then disappears reply alice says july at pm i think that he is right about not feeling like elementary is going to steal sherlock s audience sherlock stays mostly true to the plots of the original stories changing things here and there to make it fit in with modern times elementary takes a completely different spin on things for example making watson a girl which may be interesting to watch however i think that people like me who have read the sherlock holmes stories numerous times and who are absolutely in love with them will perfer sherlock that and i have a huge crush on benedict cumberbatch reply sue says july at pm who doesn t have a huge crush on benedict lol reply lady heliotrope says july at pm sherlock stays mostly true to the plots of the original stories changing things here and there to make it fit in with modern times mmmmmmm i know what you mean but no that credential goes more to jeremy brett s tv series part of the fun of the sherlock bbc is the changes that manifested for example the tease about rache and the police assuming it was an unfinished word rachel in the books whereas the reverse delightfully takes place in sherlock bbc part of the charm of sherlock bbc is the close attention to canon do i anticipate elementary will do this absolutely not they re not sherlockians but i do hope the product is good on its own merit reply lady heliotrope says july at pm i mean to say moffat and gatiss paid close attention to canon and tweaked it it s fresh and fun because they explicitly did not give a playbyplay of the books in fact not a single episode has gone exactly like a single one of the stories they are all interwoven in a very modern easter egg fashion for us hardcore fans who know the stories already forward to back in its essence sherlock bbc is a fantastic mindblowingly good fan creation elementary writers i believe will not even open the books but i still remain optimistic for elementary reply monoi says july at pm because americans are egocentric idiots reply moni says august at pm not all of us reply sue says july at pm watson being paid to work with holmes is what bugs me about elementary it can t help but give their relationship a different dynamic and bbc sherlock is absolutely brilliant i find it hard to believe that elementary will even come close to being as good reply moni says august at pm that bugs me too it gives it a total materialistic leaning which is not what real friends are about reply lady heliotrope says july at pm hey just a question i m a fan of bbc and i think there s room for more holmes lore in all mediums sherlock holmes is a character of archetypal proportions i feel it would be just as ridiculous to say there s not enough room for another god in the greek pantheon to say that there isn t enough room for cbs elementary i will watch it when convenient no tv but here s my question why does watson along with the gender change have to be dishonorably discharged honor loyalty and virtue are things intrinsic to watson loyalty ultimately wins out every time but doing the honorable thing is a close second choice when loyalty does not enter the picture i hope the reason is exceptionally good for the character s loss of her credentials which seems a ridiculous reason for changing her professional orientation why not a hostile workplace that s certainly common enough particularly in the culture of medicine which is still patriarchal and can be at times antagonistic towards women and nonwhite medical professionals i hope that these elements of her identity are something to do with the loss of her credentials in a world where women especially nonwhite and immigrant women are struggling to mediate between work and family i d hate to see this potential for a great character study become a predictable endresult like lose your job because you acted out of compassion when a man would have had the common sense to get the job done without letting his feelings getting in the way no problem have babies with the next unstable person you work for that s all you re worth anyway i don t anticipate that elementary will actually comment on these social challenges but if the role of the woman doesn t become the same old thing that it always is james bond esque i will be intrigued a rather common theme in many medical political workplace dramas of the day i believe er set it in motion maybe with nurse jackie trying to challenge it recently reply linda says july at pm good point about watson s character we ll have to wait and see how they handle it reply janet says july at pm i ve seen the elementary pilot and i am a huge fan of the bbc sherlock they are quite different and as i am fond of saying any dose of sherlock holmes is better than no dose of sherlock holmes reply brandy says july at pm i m a huge bbc sherlock fan as well as a johnsherlock shipper i m pretty excited for elementary and i think that if they can do a badass female watson with nominimal ust it will be awesome people said starbuck could never be a woman too reply molly says july at am yes and they said they didn t do that to create a starbuckapollo romance too how long did that last again reply mybenediction says july at pm i nearly blew my top when i heard about this then i thought fair enough we don t own the books let them have a go then they announced the female watson oh dear logic what that is a line that should never be crossed i think johnny will make a good sherlock i saw him opposite benny in frankenstein and he was brilliant not quote as brilliant as benny but he s a class actor however taking the friendship between the two men is just the most awful mistake it is to put it frankly fan fiction not that im putting down fan fic i love it i write it but thats where it should remain why not just make watson a talking hedgehog the whole arch of sherlock holmes is the friendship of two men so sadly because of that i will not be watching it it is a step too far i find that a great shame as i would have liked to have seen johnny given the chance to explore that friendship and if you were lucky enough to see frankenstein you will know he could have played it beautifully sad but bless benedict tactful as always such a gent reply mrscumberbatch says july at pm everything that i know about elementary makes me cringe there are too many changes the characters are sherlock holmes and johnjoan watson in name only sherlock would never say sometimes i hate it when i m right reply moni says august at pm you are so right sherlock would never say that reply april says july at pm just because there hasn t been a female watson doesn t mean there there can t or should never be a female watson and if they do hookup who cares it s tv and most people do like when the characters get together on tv and why are people who watch bbc s sherlock act like no one is aloud to like elementary if they like sherlock i hardly think watching and liking elementary will take anything away from sherlock reply nick says july at pm this is the sanest comment i ve seen on this post all day i agree reply april says july at pm well thank you reply nick says july at pm you re welcome reply molly says july at pm this show is going to tank as lucy liu cannot act recast the part reply renee says july at pm what a nice man i love sherlock and i m looking forward to elementary reply vincentdante says july at pm i guess no one reading this article recalls the brilliant they might be giants where george c scott believes he is sherlock holmes and his female psychiatrist is dr watson as i recall there was even an nbc pilot years ago based on the movie reply stacey says july at pm sorry jolly good pilot unless they ve made drastic changes in the past month we ve seen two very different pilots it was bad as a cop drama and a sherlock holmes adaptation jonny lee miller was the only passable part so far the part they ve written for joan watson is ghastly and that s without comparing it to a holmeswatson relationship i don t even want to get into that reply see all comments todays hottest stories greys anatomy scoop alex and jos latest threat meredith dancing
