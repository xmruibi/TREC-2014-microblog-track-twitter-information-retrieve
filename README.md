TREC-2014-microblog-track-twitter-information-retrieve
======================================================

uring that project, I was in charge of query expansion and document expansion with index creation. And I tried to use Wordnet to fetch synonyms and retrieve Web pagesâ€™ contents from Google results to expend queries. For document expansion, we did VSM to evaluate similar microblog and retrieved each microblog with 100 similar microblogs. In fact, at first, I came up with an idea about using clustering methods by Mahout API, which although failed finally due to the tense schedule.
